In Westbury England, Giles rides a horse through an open plain. Having dismounted, he slowly aproaches a large tree with Willow sitting at it's base. Willow stares at the ground and magically the ground produces a large tropical flower, rising up from the grass. "That doesn't belong there" says Giles, to which Willow agrees. He thinks it's a native of Paraguai, which upon closer examination of the flower, confirms his guess. He asks where it came from. Willow says "Paraguai", then smiles, telling him that the Earth is all connected. She muses about the Earth's mystical powers, which reminds Giles of one of Willow's Teacher/Mentors in the Coven. Willow remarks how she is envious of them and respects them, but she can feel that they are frightened of her and her power. Giles simply chalks it up to being cautious, noting that she's powerful with magic, and that it is an ingrained part of her, it's not an addiction. Willow tells Giles that she thought that he was going to kill her, take away her magic and punish her for killing. "Instead you go Dumbledore all on me, learning about magic and energy and Gaia and root systems." "Is that what you want? Giles asks. "I want to be Willow" she answers sadly. Giles says that she is still Willow, no matter what has happened, and she always will be.

Anya admits defeat at the stain (either blood or pizza,    can't tell) and hands the shirt to Buffy (who yes, is standing in a frilly lacey    thing. whoo whoo!). Anya then starts to rant about the "sham" date    of Xanders. Buffy says it doesn't appear to be bothering her, but Anya says    that it of course bothers her a great deal. Buffy then takes that moment to    get the heck out of there. She hits the hallway and runs right into Spike, who    very gentlemanly looks at her and around her, but not AT her, as she is just    a tad awkward at her appearance and debates whether to cover herself with the    shirt. Calmly, nicely, Spike says she looks nice and says he hears she's got    a date. Buffy says that it's unclear what it is, whether it's a promotion or    checking up on the principal or what, but Spike can sense her avoidance of the    real subject and he says it's alright, he's not being nobel or anything, everything    is fine with them and the fact that she's going out on a date. Buffy then suggests    he try it himself, going out and having fun, and remembers his date to Anya's    Wedding. Spike says the gal wasn't his type really. Buffy then says she has    to get ready a little anxously and walks past Spike, who stares off with this...    look in his eye (hard to tell what he's feeling here).

Principal Wood sits at his desk, facing two uncaring teens  who had apparently defaced a wall somewhere. The Principal threatens suspension  and marks on their permanent records, or they can repaint the wall. The two teen  boys easily say suspend us, which Wood rolls his eyes at. He then admits the the  boys that the whole "permanent records" thing is pretty much a sham, and that  doing the paperwork for suspension is a big pain for him, so instead, he's just  going to call up the Police. Given that choice, the boys "willingly" agree to  repaint the wall. A knock is heard, and Wood meets Dawn, who stopped in to  inform him that Buffy won't be in at work today, she's been up all night  vomiting, and vomiting again, and again, and then again. Wood says they'll  muddle on without her, which Dawn smiles and goes off.

The next morning, Willow doesn't just have to cope with Veruca having called her a "groupie" when Oz introduced them and the feeling that Oz is mentally absent, but also with Buffy - who seems to be suffering from "Black Frost" in more than the usual way. She seems to be dumbing down more and more just sitting watching a Luscious Jackson video. That evening when Buffy drinks herself further and further into idiocy we get a glimpse why: Jack has a chemical lab set up and is putting more into the beer than just malt.

Episode Summary by: Alan Hufana
|
Still chased by the clown, Xander teams up with Willow and Giles. He decides to confront the clown, punching him and feeling liberated. As Willow, Xander and Giles find Buffy's grave, Giles claims it is his nightmare, letting Buffy die. Buffy crawls out of the grave-a vampire. They all decide to wake up Billy from his coma to stop the nightmares. In the hospital, they find Billy's astral body near Billy's comatose body. As the ugly man finds him, Buffy confronts him. After knocking him out, she forces Billy to face him. Billy wakes up and everything is back to normal.
|
The Summers women are at the hospital when Dr. Aaron Kriegel informs Joyce she'll have surgery in two days. The rest of the gang does their best to patrol and rid Sunnydale of a few more undead residents, hoping to prevent Buffy from being unnecessarily bothered while she is dealing with her mom's health. Meanwhile, Riley allows another female vampire to feed from him; he does not stake this one.
|
A moment of passion turns to terror as Buffy discovers Angel's true identity and learns about the Gypsy curse that has haunted him for almost 100 years.

Anya causes a massacre.

The cobra demon arrives at the magic shop and goes after Dawn. Dawn screams in fear and the cobra retreats. Realising that the cobra knows Dawn is the Key and is returning to inform Glory, Giles and Buffy go after the demon. Buffy catches up with it in a field near Glory's apartment and kills it, then lets out her pent-up frustration from her time at the hospital by continuing to beat up the lifeless cobra. Glory watches from a window, frustrated that her snake monster has failed to return in a timely manner. Joyce tells Dawn the truth about her health. Riley is there to comfort Buffy  but she refuses to accept comfort from him - she insists that she needs to stay strong for her family, refusing to cry. Joyce calls for Buffy and she turns and walks away, oblivious to his attempt to caress her face. Riley is left standing alone in the hallway, becoming increasingly frustrated with Buffy's inability or unwillingness to develop an emotional closeness with him, and to let herself be vulnerable around him.
|
Spike has since appeared in the background and quietly starts    to have another chip episode, falling ot his knees, but everyone is still too    stunned by Warren's appearance. Dawn asks what happened as Willow/Warren admits    she doesn't know, that she probably brought it on herself. She/he explains they    were upstairs, she and Kennedy kissed, and then it happened. Buffy ask what    makes her think that, as Willow/Warren says she has a history of making weird    magic stuff happen and brings up the events from her dissapearing act upon returning    to Sunnydale. While this discussion happens, Andrew and Dawn are poking and    prodding Willow/Warren, trying to see if it is real. Buffy then asks why Willow's    subconcious would turn her into Warren. Willow/Warren's only answer is that    she probably feels remorse over killing Warren. Willow/Warren then starts to    get flustered, saying that she'll fix it and that she's embarassed by the others    seeing her like that and she/he starts to head out. Buffy tries to stop her/him,    but Willow/Warren says it's ok, she got herself into it, she'll get herself    out, then she says they've got other things to worry about and glances at Spike    on the floor behind them, who still rolls around in discomfort and is disoriented.    Willow/Warren goes out the front door as the other Scoobies gather around Spike.    Buffy tries to comfort Spike by saying they'll hopefully get a phone call back,    but Spike says they can't wait, it's gettting worse. Kennedy, seeing everyone    distracted by Spike, slips out after Willow/Warren.

|
Buffy tracks down Parker, but she finds him putting the same moves he used on her on another girl. She asks him if everything is okay, and Parker, completely casual, tells her it is. She asks if he wants to do something, but Parker refuses citing earlier plans and attempts to rush off. Buffy asks if she did something wrong, but Parker assures her she didn't and he had a lot of fun. Buffy realizes that, while their night together meant a lot to her, for him it was nothing more than casual sex. He reminds her that it was her that put the moves on him, and claims that he thought they were on the same level. He then quickly leaves, telling Buffy that he'll call her when he clearly has no intention of doing so. As Buffy reels, she turns around when she hears a familiar voice and Spike hits her.
|
Later, Willow presents the antidote to Buffy in a mug and leaves her to drink it as Spike delivers a selfish monologue urging her to abandon the life that's grown so hellish for her and choose peace with him, also threatening Buffy to either tell her friends about their sexual relationship or he do it for her. This misfires, convincing Buffy to reject the antidote (which she pours unnoticed in the trash) and with it, the delusion of being a vampire slayer. In the hospital, Buffy tells the doctor and her parents that she wants to be healthy and rid of thoughts about Sunnydale. The doctor tells her that she has to do what is necessary to destroy the elements that draw her back there, like her family and friends, to truly be healthy.
|
Buffy's father shows up and calmly tells her that she is at fault for her parents' divorce, because she is such a difficult child and he can't stand being around her. Then he scolds her for crying at his hurtful accusations and tells her he never wants to see her again. The Scooby Gang quickly figures out that their nightmares are becoming reality, including Xander's nightmare of being chased by a clown and Willow's nightmare of appearing on stage, expected to perform Madama Butterfly. Buffy finds Billy's astral body, and then they are both found by the man who assaulted Laura. Nightmares plague everyone and Buffy learns Billy has experienced some sort of punishment for poor baseball skills. They evade the scary man and find themselves in a graveyard where The Master confronts Buffy, and buries her alive.

Dropping down to the floor below, Adam pulls from his pocket a stack of computer disks that he retrieved from the lab.  Inserting them into a disk drive in his chest one by one, Adam recalls files that detail his own existence as a "kinematically redundant, biomechanical demonoid".  After inserting a disk labeled "Finn", Adam tells Riley how the two of them are connected in the eyes of the late Maggie Walsh.  While Maggie literally constructed Adam with various parts of humans, demons, and machines, Professor Walsh was also responsible for creating Riley.  Although Riley has a true biological family in Iowa, it wasn't until he met Maggie Walsh that he started his path to becoming the soldier that he is today, due in part to the chemicals that he was fed daily.  When Adam offers to disclose the full scope of Maggie's plan for the two of them, Riley puts a stop to the back story by aiming his gun at the creature.  In a blinding instant, Adam shoves the gun aside, knocks Buffy to the floor, and sends Riley flying across the room with a thunderous punch.  After flooring Xander easily, Adam extracts his bone skewer and drives it through a fleeing Angleman, who dies instantly.  Riley makes another attempt to fight, but Adam quickly stabs the soldier's torso with his bloody skewer.  Down for the count, Riley can only watch as Buffy tries her hand at fighting Adam.  Unfortunately, her blows have virtually no effect on Adam, who crushes her to the floor once again.  As the rest of the Initiative squad tries to bust into the room, Adam escapes through a ceiling vent.  Just as his feet disappear into the shaft, the rest of the team barges in, completely unaware of the departed Adam.  Riley confirms Buffy's story that Adam was responsible for his own injury as well as Dr. Angleman's murder.  While the troops launch a search for the creature, Forrest orders Buffy to back off and let them take Riley to a military hospital.

"Yeah. With the hoodies and the crazy alphabet eyes. I  didn't see. I just heard that..." says SIT number 3, Molly (Cockney accent,  brunette with long pigtails, colorful pinkish jacket, kinda girlish-punk).  Annabelle hushes Molly as Giles continues.

The UberVamp attacks again, and this time it is mostly a one  sided battle. Buffy is on the defensive, trying to block and dodge, but she is  grabbed, thrown into cave walls, slashed with her own stake, and gets her hand  crushed by a blocked, caught punch. The UberVamp grabs her by the throat and  raises her up, but Buffy out of desperation grabs a nearby stalactite  (stalagmite? whichever one points down) and bops the UberVamp on the head with  it. She then rushes over to the open cave ceiling where she fell through and  starts to scramble up the side. She reaches the top and starts to claw her way  out, but UberVamp has other ideas, grabbing her ankle and dragging her back  down. On the way down she kick him again and scrambles up again. The UberVamp  follows, and just as he's about to crawl out of the hole, Giles is seen, or  rather a silhouette of Giles standing in front of a new day's dawn (it's kinda  weird, like Giles appearing to glow for a second, but I don't wanna read into  anything). The UberVamp shades it's eyes and crawls back down below in the  pit.

At the Bronze, Xander sees Cordy and walks over to give her his gift. After admiring the necklace for a moment, Cordy breaks up with him. Xander is righteously furious, and it only gets worse for him the next day, as everyone in school seems to know that they broke up. Xander then notices Amy walking around, so he runs over and tells her that he knows she's practicing witchcraft. With the upper hand, Xander strikes a deal with Amy: help him cast a love spell on Cordy, and nobody will have to know that she's a witch. After arguing the idea for a while, Amy concedes and tells Xander that she needs a personal item of Cordelia's. Xander finds Cordy near her locker and demands that she return the necklace he gave her. Cordy says it's in her locker, but when she opens it, she hides behind the locker door so she can remove the necklace from her neck without Xander seeing. Meanwhile, Buffy walks into the library and shows Giles the "Soon" card. Buffy demands that Giles tell her everything she needs to know about Angel and Valentine's Day, so Giles sits her down and proceeds to read various anecdotes from his books.

Just as he tells her that she does not have to "go into the darkness," Wesley and several other men crash into the mansion. The men subdue Angel while Wesley unlocks Faith's chains. Immediately after unlocking the last chain, Wesley restrains Faith with his own cuffs, informing the Slayer that she will be brought to face the Council. In the truck, Faith tricks one of the men into getting closer. She then captures and threatens to snap his neck unless Wesley frees her from the restraints. Wesley follows her orders. As soon as she's freed, Faith knocks Wesley to the floor and jumps out of the back of the truck.

At the park, Buffy talks with Angel, who convinces her not to give up fighting. When he makes a passing remark about the children and their parents, Buffy is struck by the thought that the children's parents were never seen or mentioned, and the fact that no one knows the children's names. After using the Internet to contact Willow, the Scooby Gang learns that every fifty years throughout history, the murdered bodies of two nameless children have been found, resulting in peaceful communities being torn apart by vigilante chaos. The earliest record dating from Germany during 1649, where a cleric from the Black Forest discovered the corpses of "Hans and Greta Strauss", inspiring the fairy tale of Hansel and Gretel. Giles explains that certain demons thrive on watching humans destroy each other through persecution and ignorance. According to Giles, this is what set off the Salem Witch Trials.

Just then, Buffy and Riley walk in and convince him to hand the gun over to Buffy. Buffy explains to the Xanders that they are both Xander and they can't kill each other. They all decide to go back to Giles' house, but before they can leave, Toth crashes through the front door of the apartment. Toth threatens Buffy by telling her that he would not miss again and takes another shot at her with his device. Buffy somersaults out of the way, missing the blast as Riley jumps on Toth from behind knocking the device out of the demon's grasp. Buffy finishes the job by slaying the demon with a sword. Back at Giles' place, the gang marvels at the fact that they now have two Xanders. Giles researches a way to reintegrate them, but Anya says that there is no hurry- she wants to take them both home and Giles can put them back together in the morning. Giles suggests to everyone that they start the integration process and pretend that they didn't hear the disturbing sex talk.

Once the mildly skeptical Joyce goes upstairs, Buffy pretends to send Angel off, but instead sneaks him up to her bedroom. Angel says he doesn't want to get her into anymore trouble, but Buffy replies firmly that she doesn't want to "get him dead" - to which Angel makes no response. They discuss the room's one bed and Angel insists on taking the floor, whereupon Buffy sends him to the window to see whether the "fang gang" is still lurking so his back will be turned while she changes. Still trying to figure him out, Buffy asks why Angel, not being The Chosen One, elects to fight vampires. At his non-committal reply, she wonders what his family thinks of his career choice, then looks around at him when he says, "They're dead." "I'm sorry," Buffy replies, but the conversation is suddenly in murky waters. When she quietly asks if it was vampires that killed his family, he replies with apparent difficulty, "It was." Buffy further theorizes that hunting vampires is some kind of "vengeance gig" for him, but with a hint of desperation, Angel changes the subject. Buffy accepts the gambit and they settle down for the night in their respective spots.

Early next morning before sunrise, Buffy and Giles hear on the radio that Theresa was found dead, and her murder may be linked to the werewolf. They now have only night left before the werewolf goes into remission for the remainder of the month. As the sun rises, the werewolf slowly transforms back to human form while it is sleeping. Once all the hair fades away to reveal flesh, we see that the werewolf is Oz. After waking up and realizing that he is naked in the woods, Oz suspects that he may be the werewolf. He goes home and calls his aunt. Oz asks her about his cousin Jordy, who bit him recently. Apparently, his aunt knows that Jordy is a werewolf, and since he bit Oz, the curse has been passed along. Oz goes to school that day in a daze, and he is horrified to learn that he may have killed Theresa the previous night. Xander suspects that Larry may be the werewolf, so he leaves to question him in the locker room. Willow invites Oz to help her do some research later that night, but Oz refuses and runs off, leaving Willow upset over his apparent change of heart. In the locker room, Xander confronts Larry in the locker room. Xander tells him that he knows the secret that Larry has been hiding, only to find out that Larry's secret is his homosexuality. Misunderstanding Xander's words, Larry now believes that Xander is also gay, but assures him that their secret is safe between them. Feeling relieved and better about himself, Larry thanks Xander and walks off.

Buffy asks Spike what he thinks. Spike    doesn't care as long as it's not pointed at him, it keeps 'the boy' busy. Buffy    is still upset, but not at Andrew. She sighs as she starts to address the others,    saying she has to tell them what's really going on. This prompts Andrew to back    out of the room slowly, camcorder still filming...

After much thought and discussion with Willow, Buffy decides to tell Giles what happened, only to discover that Faith has already told him that Buffy was the killer.

Meanwhile, Ken has gotten Lily to change clothes for the "cleansing" and leads her into another room, where he tells her to enter a strange, dirty pool of water. At the front door of "Family Home", Buffy tries to enter undercover. When that doesn't work, she kicks down the door and finds Ken with Lily over the water. However, it's too late for Lily, as the "pool" is actually a portal. Buffy and Ken fight, Buffy trying to save her friend. Instead, both fall through the black pool and into another dimension where time flows at a different rate. Ken reveals himself as a demon of some sort with a human face glued on, and sends his guards after the girls. The two are quickly caught and told that they will be living there for as long as they can serve as useful slaves. In this dimension time runs differently: a century passes in their dimension, but only a day on Earth. Slaves who are too old to work are returned to their former dimension to die on the streets. Buffy then realizes that this is what happened to Rickie. They have been chosen because they're "no one"-there is nobody to miss them or notice their absence. Buffy says she wasn't chosen, but Ken tells her that it doesn't matter, because he knows who she is-she's Anne, a runaway anxious to get lost and hide in the shadows.

As Buffy looks for a weapon big enough to toast this mama bazor, the Gorch brothers show up.

Somehow Buffy emerges victorious and the Gorches know they've met their match.

Meanwhile, Spike, confined to a wheelchair and recovering slowly from his injuries, tries to talk Dru into having her party in Vienna to escape further interference from Angel and the Slayer. In contrast, Drusilla seems both entirely cured by the interrupted ritual using Angel's blood and completely unscathed by the ensuing disaster in the church. Nor does she share Spike's emotional distress, dismissing his request to leave "cursed" Sunnydale and continuing to decorate their lair for the upcoming event. When Dru begins to fuss over the flowers, however, Spike indulges her with a peek into one of her presents. "It reeks of death," she purrs, then slams the box shut.

He became the embodiment of the demon Lohesh, and she was there to witness it.  Lohesh, a four-winged soul killer, decimated the village within hours  only a small handful of people survived.  Anya explains that an Ascension means that a human being becomes pure demon.  She tells them that all the demons that walk the earth are tainted, or human hybrids like vampires, but that a pure demon is different.  She doesn't think this sounds like Lohesh, though, because the rituals are all different.  Just as she says this, the Mayor bursts into the library.

Hospital drama to die for

Outside of Sunnydale University, Willow talks (and starts to plead) with one of her old instructors to come back to classes, but the instructor says it's ok, she can't deny one of her best students. The teacher comments that she saw Willow's grades start to slip at mid term, but then she turned it around and got straight A's out of nowhere, "As if, boom, like magic." The instructor tells Willow to meet her during her office hours the next day so they can talk about Willow getting caught up, then she leaves. Willow was half distracted during the instructor's departure, noticing Anya walking out of a fraternaty house wearing an old raincoat, noticably trying to keep herself covered. Willow calls her over and is all excited to tell Anya about her return to school, and all the homework and surprise quizzes they have planned for her, but Anya looks tired, uneasy, a little confused. Willow asks her what she's doing there, walking out of the fraternity house. Anya tells Willow nervously that she's there to see her new boyfriend, and that they just had lots and lots of sex. Willow smiles, saying that's great that she's moving on, but she notices a smear of blood on Anya's palm as Anya went to brush her hair back. Anya nervously excuses herself and leaves as Willow (naturally) heads towards the Frat house to investigate.

I don't know about the  breath/vampire thing, so don't ask) MorphyDru looks on as the UberVamp holds  Spike under. He then picks him up and throws him out of the pool. "That's why  our kind make such good dollys" MorphyDru quips as Spike gurgles up a mouthful  of water "hard to kill..." MorphyDru comments on how Spike tried to spill the  secrets to Buffy, but he won't be able to now. In her usual wacked-out manner,  MorphyDru lightly flirts with Spike, then says they're not done with him yet.  She clicks her tounge as the UberVamp smiles and growls evilly, picking Spike up  and plunging his head into the water again.

After making sure that Willow is okay, Buffy leaves to find Veruca. She stops by Oz's place for assistance in tracking down Veruca. Armed with a tranquilizer rifle, Buffy follows Oz through the woods as he tries to locate the source of Veruca's scent. When they find a pile of her clothes on the floor, Buffy figures that Veruca planted them to throw Oz off her trail. Immediately, Oz realizes that Willow is in danger. He takes off in a hurry, while Buffy tries to catch up. Suddenly, Buffy runs into a masked commando, who is also armed. Their collision sends the weapons to the ground, and they get into a brief struggle. After a few well-placed kicks and punches, Buffy grabs the tranquilizer rifle and continues in the direction that Oz was headed. Meanwhile, in one of the science labs, Willow prepares to cast a vengeance spell on Oz and Veruca. Before she can complete the spell, Willow realizes her inability to go through with it, and she terminates the incantation. At that moment, Veruca enters the lab and locks the door behind her. With the sun setting into the horizon, Veruca attacks Willow just as Oz arrives on the scene. As they gradually take on their werewolf forms, Oz and Veruca battle each other. Determined to put an end to all of this, Oz ends Veruca's life by viciously gnawing at her throat. Turning his attention to Willow, Oz lunges to attack. However, his assault is put on hold by Buffy, who grabs his leg and pulls him in the other direction. One shot from the tranquilizer rifle puts Oz's frenzy to rest, allowing Buffy to take care of her traumatized friend.

Willow sits in Principal Woods' office, the Scythe before her. While chanting a spell, she places her hands upon the Scythe, and both she and the Scythe light up in an ethereal glow and her hair turns white, the opposite of Dark Willow.

At the Bronze that evening, a group plays (I'm pretty sure it's the Breeders that i've heard mentioned, but don't quote me) as we see the standard mass of people dancing and Buffy, Xander, and Willow sitting at a table. Xander tells the girls that Spike doesnt' seem as nuts as he first was, but wonders if getting a soul back means you'd pick up the wet towels off the floor? "No, but maybe now he's feeling really bad about leaving them there." Willow quips and Buffy says "at leas he's showering." Xander and Buffy then notice RJ dancing out on the floor at the same time and comment that he's the boy that Dawn has the hots for. He's dancing with a quasi-slutty girl, who bumps and grinds with him, really moving it. Xander makes a slightly inappropriate Daddy comment and Buffy comments on her "painted on" shirt and starts to say she's glad to see Dawn isn't here to see her wanna-be boyfriend see the display, but just then quasi-slut girl turns around and, much to the scoobie's shock, it's Dawn! Buffy is shocked as Xander backpeddals on his Daddy comment, practically scratching his eyes out. "right there with ya" willow comments.

Buffy is finishing dressing as Giles approaches her, still    not happy with her de-chipping of Spike. Giles asks her why on Earth she made    that decision. Buffy chalks it up to instinct, like the instinct Giles used    to detect the Bringer. Giles admits he made up his previous "heroic"    tale, the truth being he detected the Bringer because his shoes squeaked! Giles    expresses his concern about the dangers the SIT's are all facing and lists them.    Buffy adds "and the Principal" as an afterthought, which Giles questions.    Buffy says that the Principal was acting supicous and she was keeping an eye    on him. Giles turns the talk back to Spike, again expressing concern and doubt    about an unchipped Spike, but Buffy tries to calm him down, saying that she    has faith in Spike and that they have to give him a chance. Giles then tells    Buffy he wants more for her and he can tell that she still has feelings for    the blonde vampire. Buffy tries to reassure him that She and Spike aren't physical    and that the chip was like a muzzle for Spike. "You can't be evil by doing    evil" she ends the conversation with and walks out, with Giles saying "I    hope you're right. You're gambling with a lot of lives."

The scythe is held as we hear Buffy's voice "you feel    it too, don't you?" "Damn, that's something..." Faith says as    she holds the scythe in both hands. She sits up in her bed and comments how    the weapon feels like power and how it belongs to her. Then she hands the weapon    to Buffy and says "I guess that means it's yours." Buffy says it belongs    to the Slayer. Faith corrects her and says the Slayer in charge. The two girls    talk and Faith says she's not looking for forgiveness, she screwed up and some    of the girls died. Buffy says she didn't screw up, this is war, and war is about    death. People will die, it's not her fault. Faith then says that the funny part    is that all her life she's been a loner, never having any ties (except for the    time with Robin she says, which prompts a short "sex with the principal"    talk), and that she was jealous of everything that Buffy had with friends and    such. Then suddenly she has the power and people to lead and she never felt    more alone. Faith realizes that that's what Buffy goes through every day. Buffy    says that she loves her friends, but that's the price of being a Slayer, always    being alone. Faith wonders if that's why they can never get along, because there's    only supposed to be one Slayer. "Also you went evil and started killing    people" Buffy quips. "Good point, also a factor." Faith acknowleges.    They both agree that being a Slayer is something others just won't understand.    "Thank god we're hot chicks with superpowers" Faith says. "Takes    the edge off" Buffy responds. "Comforting." Faith says.

Inside the brother's home, Xander sits across from him as he wonders how things are going since high school, then upon mentioning RJ, the brother says that RJ is doing good and he's a real nice guy. He then reminices about how popular he was. As the brother talks about how popular yet 'caring' RJ is, Spike listens, walking nearby (Spike notices some porceline angel statue-ettes on a shelf nearby and slowly turns a few of them to face away from him). The brother comments how one year RJ just seemed to "Blossom" into a popular guy. Xander asks if he knows how this happened, but then Spike interrupts, seeing a picture of RJ and another of his Brother, both wearing the same letterman Jacket. "Lance" (finally, i caught the brother's name!) says that the jacket was his fathers, and his father handed it down to him, and he gave it to his brother, yada yada.

Willow rebuffs with "Hello, gay now!" Olaf storms into the shop and intends to hurt the girls, but Xander arrives before the two most important women in his life are seriously wounded. The troll beats Xander up badly, then tells Xander to choose whether Anya or Willow will die. Xander refuses to choose, proving his loyalty to both girls, but when Olaf decides to kill Xander, Anya offers herself. Buffy arrives and fights with the troll while Willow works on a spell and Anya distracts Olaf with insults. When Olaf says that Anya and Xander won't last, Buffy gets incredibly angry and beats the troll into unconsciousness.

She tries to convince him to see the doctor, but Riley tells her that he doesn't trust the Initiative's doctor and fears that they will take away his superpowers. He fears that if he loses his superpowers, he'll be just like everyone else and thinks that Buffy won't be interested in him anymore. Buffy tearfully confides to Riley that she loves him with or without his superpowers, and that she needs him and will take him to the doctor no matter what. Riley finally agrees.

The Scooby Gang discusses plans for Buffy's birthday and dealing with Glory. Gilestells everyone of the new information they have regarding Glory that the council has provided; she was a hellgod from one of the darker demon dimensions who has somehow found her way into ours. While she is immortal and apparently invulnerable due to being stuck in human form, she is also mostly insane and needs to suck mental energy from humans, thus explaining the sudden increase of people going crazy in Sunnydale. Xander suggests that they try hunting down the Key that Glory is looking for, but as the gang start to discuss this plan Buffy and Giles admit they know where the Key is. Xander and Willow are hurt that information was kept from them, and Buffy decides to tell the gang the truth about Dawn, reasoning that they deserve to know the full story as their lives will be on the line.

"She's not the Anya that you knew, Xander. She's a demon." Buffy tries to reason with Xander "That doesn't mean you have to kill her!" he says back, very bothered. Buffy says this isn't easy for her. Xander says there are other options, to which Buffy says she's considered them. Xander is upset now "When? Just now? It took you all of 10 seconds to consider killing one of your best friends?" Buffy says the thought that this would have to be done has been had before. Xander says there's got to be another way, and says that it can be reversed. He says the boy's deaths are mystical and can be reversed, turning to Willow for agreement. Willow says no, that's something way to powerful to be done, raising so many dead, and that even if she had that power, she doesn't trust herself with it. Buffy says it's ok and turns to Xander, saying she knows it's tough for him to hear, but it's what she has to do. "Hard for me to hear? Buffy, you want to kill Anya!" Xander shouts, getting more upset. "I don't WANT to." Buffy argues back. Xander continues, saying Anya needs help, that this isn't new ground for them, and when their friends go all crazy and kill people they try to help them. "Sitting right here..." Willow says, to which Xander apologizes, but continues with his rant.

Giles worries about the missing vampire and what was taken from the mausoleum. We see Spike with a coffin pillow adorned with a cross -- part of the cure. He knows if Buffy keeps interrupting, he'll never get the key to curing Drusilla, so he decides to summon bounty hunters -- the most savage of killers. Giles chastises Buffy as they examine the mausoleum together and Giles finds the name "duLac" -- he was the author of the stolen book Spike has; a book of evil spells written in archaic Latin. They realize the cross has been stolen from his crypt, and it is the tool which will allow Spike to wreak havoc -- Giles says he must decipher the book first in order to save them. Meanwhile, we strangers start hitting town and doing their damage-- one is a door-to-door cosmetic salesman, one is an evil-looking guy, and one is a beautiful woman.

Meanwhile, Buffy pays a visit to Willy's bar, hoping to get some information on the whereabouts of the Polgara demon.  However, Willy hasn't heard anything about the demon since it was originally captured by Buffy and the Initiative.  As Buffy turns her line of questioning to the Initiative and 314, Riley walks in and immediately spots Buffy.  Further confused by Buffy's apparent socialization with demons, Riley demands answers from the Slayer.  Buffy notices the uncontrollable trembling in Riley's hands, which forcefully grab her by the shoulders.  When a woman tries to leave the scene, Riley draws his gun and levels it at the frightened patron's head.  Buffy and Willy try to talk him out of it, but Riley cannot manage to distinguish right from wrong, good from bad, anymore.  Finally, Riley lowers his gun and slumps onto the counter, allowing the terrified woman to make a hasty exit.  After Buffy brings him back to Xander's apartment, Riley struggles to understand what is happening to him.  As Riley declares the loss of everything he's ever held to be true, Buffy notices a crimson rash on his hand.  Riley's nails continuously scratch at the rash, and Buffy pulls his hands apart.  Pulling a scarf from her hair, Buffy wraps the garment over Riley's wounded hand before getting him to rest.  By the laundry machines, Giles and Anya tell Buffy of the inconsistencies between the young boy's murder and the documented behavioral patterns of the Polgara demon.  Suspicious of Riley's deteriorating physical condition, Buffy believes that there is more to it than grief.  She asks Xander to accompany her on an investigation of the Initiative laboratory.

Still night-time in Xander's apartment, Xander lays in bed    as a J-Lo-ish looking SIT sits on the bed in her jammies and talks to him, saying    that she's "so scared" and "so young" and such. UBER flirtatious.    Xander is talking reasonably, but she is obviously hinting, saying things like    she's never experienced things, never had a boyfriend. Xander starts to perk    up as she says "I've never been with a man." "I've never been    with a man before either" says a second SIT, coming up behind the first    and sitting on the bed. Both eye Xander with seduction as Xander's attention    is definitely gained. Both approach him seductively as he says they can't, the    others might hear them. "No they won't" both SIT's say as they lean    down to kiss him. Just then (in slow motion) the door to his living room swings    open and we see feathers flying everywhere! Girls in skimpy nighties and underwear    jump and bounce, flinging pillows at each other in a playful manner. The scene    is every man's dream...

"Then there came the demons" Dawn    continues and Xander places another metal shadow plate in the pedestal It casts    the shadow of a large, toothy demon as a howling/snarling is heard in the background.    "After the demons then came men." A plate with three tribal men-figures    is placed and it's shadow casts on the wall. "the men found a girl"    (shadow plate of a lone woman is cast) "and the men took the girl took    the girl to fight the de mon... to fight all the demons. They chained her to    the Earth.." (shadow plate of long shackle attached to the ground). "And    then.. I ... I... I can't read this. Something about Darkness?" Dawn is    becoming a little scared and confused, trying to translate, as the shadows flicker    on the wall. The pedestal now starts to rotate by itself as the drum beats in    the background grow steadily louder. "You cannot be shown. You cannot just    watch but you must see. See for yourself but only if you're willing to make    the exchange" Dawn says rapidly, which prompts Xander to ask when Dawn    became so good in Summerian. Dawn says the book isn't in Summerian anymore as    we see the book's writings glow and turn into English! The pedestal now spins    faster and the light starts to grow, the shadows on the wall taking on a life    of their own as we see the girl struggle against the chains, the demons approach,    and the three tribal men beat staffs on the ground.

Buffy says that her plate    is full right now with other stuff and that she is a little nervous about leaving    Spike in Robin's care. Giles says everyone else seemed to like the arrangement,    then goes on to say that while technically not her Watcher anymore, he can still    impart valuable lessons to her and that she must look at the big picture. Buffy    counters, saying that she's seen the big picture, giving big motivational speeches    and knows it's serious. Giles says that to win this war, she has to be able    to make some tough decisions, regardless of cost.. Buffy fights back, saying    that she has treated her friends, family, and Andrew very poorly because she    knows what it takes to win. "Well, that's what we're here to find out,    while we work on the basics" Giles says as a vampire's hand shoots up from    a nearby grave.

Out on patrol, Buffy runs into Riley again and Riley resumes their earlier conversation. He tells Buffy that she needs to be more positive, to not look for the bad in the situation. He tells her he doesn't care about her past and begs her to just take a chance on him, but she continues to refuse. Meanwhile, at the library, Willow and Xander search for the Word of Valios, while an unappreciative Spike cheers himself up by verbally tearing them down, taunting them over Xander's lack of direction and Willow's inability to get Oz to stay, as well as their seeming uselessness to Buffy, insisting that they are merely "groupies" whom Buffy doesn't have the heart to turn away, and that Buffy would be a much better Slayer without constantly having to watch out for them. Though Willow and Xander protest his words as being untrue, it's clear that Spike had struck a nerve.

Buffy suspects Faith to be the culprit and the three agree the professor must have known something the Mayor wanted kept secret. Xander and Anya arrive, Anya having experienced a previous ascension. She tells them about a sorcerer who became the pure-demon Lohesh - unlike human-demon hybrids like vampires, pure-demons are much stronger and much larger. The Mayor waltzes into the library and smugly comments that he'll eat Buffy come graduation day. Upon hearing this Giles, in a fit of rage, stabs him with a sword; but the Mayor is unharmed, and merely scolds Giles for his impetuous violence - a bad example in the presence of children. He leaves with the cheery promise that some of their deaths will be quick.

Later on, Buffy, Willow and Dawn discuss Riley's health in Buffy's room. Willow says that Riley seems to be in great shape, but Buffy is not convinced. She surmises that if only they could reach the Initiative, it might shed some light on Riley's situation. Discouraged, Buffy says that it would be almost impossible to find the Initiative since they don't exist anymore and they never claimed to exist in the first place. When Dawn suggests saying something out loud in hopes that the Initiative could somehow hear it, Buffy gets an idea and quickly leaves. She arrives at Riley's place and finds nobody home. Her hunch is that Riley's phone is bugged by the Initiative. Picking up the phone, Buffy hears a couple clicks instead of a dial tone. Instead of dialing, she speaks into the 'empty' line, saying that Riley is in trouble.

To get to the box, they will need a potion to break the shield that protects it.  Willow researches a formula, and Xander and Oz concoct the potion.  With the potion in hand, Buffy, Willow and Angel climb to the top of City Hall, just above the room where the box lies.  Opening the skylight, they peer down at the box below.  Willow recites a spell, then sprinkles the potion down onto the box.  The protective shield dissolves.  Angel then straps Buffy in a harness and lowers her through the skylight and down to the box.  When she grabs the box, an alarm goes off - and as Angel tries to pull Buffy back up, the harness gets stuck.  Two of the Mayor's vamp-lackeys respond to the alarm and rush into the room.  Since the harness is still stuck, Angel drops down into the room to join Buffy in fighting the two vamp-lackeys.  After an extended fight, Angel and Buffy knock down the vamps and run out of the room.  Racing out of City Hall, they jump behind a bush to hide.  When a van pulls up in front of City Hall and then speeds away, the vamps chase after it, thinking Buffy and Angel are inside.

Meanwhile, Joyce is telling Pat in the kitchen how much it means to her to have Buffy back, though it has been harder on her than expected.

Walking in a field, Willow and Xander walk and talk about Buffy and her councelling job, but talk soon turns to the now famous line "From beneath you, it devours." "It's not the friendliest jingle, is it? It's no "I like Ike" or "Milk: It does a body good."" Xander jokes. Willow says she knows it's going to be real bad, the upcoming months, and she wonders if she'll be able to control her magic to help out. Xander compares her magic use to using a hammer, with a person either having power or control when driving a nail, but not both. Willow then looks tired and comments that she doesn't know if she's ready. Xander says it will take time and looks ahead at something. Asked if she's ready, Willow nods yes and heads off.

Oz arrives at Willow's house with videos from Big Lou's and finds she has a romantic night planned, including a provocative outfit, candles, music, and chilling champagne. In a roundabout way, she implies that she wants to make love with Oz. He tells her he's not ready to take their relationship that far, and that she doesn't need to prove herself to him. She's fine with his decision, and they kiss.

Meanwhile, Buffy patrols the city once again, only this time she's armed with her crossbow. Riley is also on duty, carrying a heavy-duty stun gun. Their encounters with the Gentlemen's lackeys leads them both to the clock tower. After subduing their opponents momentarily, Buffy and Riley raise their weapons at each other. Just as soon as they realize who they're aiming at, more lackeys arrive to interrupt the unexpected reunion. While taking care of his own struggle, Riley manages to catch a glimpse of Buffy landing a blow that sends the lackey flying across the room. Their fight takes them upstairs, where the Gentlemen wait with scalpel's in hand, hoping these two attackers will provide the remaining hearts that they need. Buffy spots the box on the table and recognizes it from her dream. Unable to reach the box herself, Buffy signals to Riley to destroy the box. After misinterpreting her intended target the first time around, Riley successfully smashes the box into debris. Instantly, the voices of Sunnydale return to their rightful owners. With her voice back, Buffy lets loose a high-pitched wail that lasts long enough to cause the Gentlemen's heads to explode.

Back at the Magic Shop, Buffy and Tara fear the worst as they view the destruction left by the troll, and take off to try to track it. The troll arrives at the Bronze, declaring his desire to drink ale and eat babies. Xander suggests that Spike fight the troll, but Spike is "paralyzed by not caring very much." The troll asks Spike and Xander where to find babies to eat. Spike suggests the troll try the hospital, and Xander ineffectually attempts to talk sense into the troll, suggesting that he sit down in one of the more sturdy chairs to have a calm talk. However, the troll is unsatisfied with their suggestions of stags, strong grog, and onion blossoms. While the troll drinks beer straight from a keg, the whole gang gathers at the Bronze. When Buffy arrives, Spike cautiously greets her, but she ignores him and he steps back, disappointed.

Buffy tosses in her sleep, then wakes up thirsty, but the water glass by her bed is empty. Seeming unaware that Drusilla silently follows, she carries her glass down the hall to find that her bathroom is really The Bronze. Buffy moves through the crowd of people dancing in slow motion, sees Willow speaking French to an organ-grinder's monkey, then encounters her mother who asks "Do you really think you're ready, Buffy?" before the saucer she holds drops to the floor and smashes. As Joyce turns away, Buffy moves back into the crush, then turns herself, smiling at something she sees behind her. The crowd has parted and Angel is slowly coming toward her, quietly smiling as well. Suddenly, Drusilla steps up behind Angel and stakes him in the back. Angel, his face a mask of agony, reaches toward Buffy's reaching hand, but his fingers turn to dust before they can touch. In vamp-face, Drusilla says "Happy birthday, Buffy." and Buffy wakes with a gasp.

Buffy wakes up at Riley's, but she's very distant from him. They talk about the night before in the graveyard and Riley's reaction to Oz, then Riley leaves after hearing news about Graham getting hurt. Willow shocks Buffy with the news about Oz being able to control the wolf. Buffy is even more shocked as Willow subtly explains that her relationship with Tara is now serious and that complicates things with Oz. Adam goes to Spike for his help in exchange for getting the chip out of Spike's head.
|
"No." Buffy tells Angel. She says that she doesn't    want to risk Angel in this, that she needs him as a back-up line of defense    if the First should manage to get out past Sunnydale. Angel argues, but Buffy    puts on her stern face and Angel folds: "OK, that's one reason... what's    the other?" "There is no other" Buffy says as she exits the tomb,    trying to avoid the subject.

Giles tells Oz and Cordelia about the mask containing the powers of the zombie demon Ovu Mobani, which means "Evil Eye." Pat puts it on and becomes the demon incarnate.

|
That night, Spike drives through the "Welcome to Sunnydale" sign again, but this time he is extremely drunk; he falls out of the car and reprises his first line in the series, "Home sweet home", before passing out. He returns to the old burned down factory (despondently singing the Frank Sinatra rendition of Paul Anka's "My Way") and surveys the damage. He begins to shout and cry, destroying Drusilla's charred dolls and drunkenly wondering why she left him.

Tara casts a spell to locate Willow and Xander. Xander questions Willow's directions back to the shop and the power of the spell she conducted. Tara's spell sends a small blue light to guide Willow and Xander back to the Magic Box.
|
At the Magic Box, the Scoobies continue to search for information that might indicate the origins, purpose, or weaknesses of Glory. Tara suggests that maybe the Beast is something that is too old for the books, which Giles believes may explain the presence of the Dagon Sphere, which is to ward against that "which cannot be named." They discuss the possibility that Glory may predate language itself, when she herself shows up there and buys several items for a spell. The gang is, of course, oblivious to her true identity, and she leaves the store without incident. Back at the hospital, the doctor tells Buffy her mother has a brain tumor and presents her with her mother's options. Ben, an intern, gets the doctor away from Buffy, giving her a break from the doctor's constant questions.

Spike embraces Drusilla while he drives away in his car. Buffy fights ferociously, and quickly backs Angelus up against the statue just as Willow finally succeeds with her spell; the Orb glows and vanishes. As Buffy is about to land the killing blow, suddenly Angel's soul is restored. He is confused and doesn't understand what is happening, not yet remembering his time as Angelus.

Angel hears something behind him, but Buffy reassures him that everything is fine. After a final kiss, Buffy tells Angel to close his eyes. When he complies, she violently stabs Angel through the chest into the vortex. A shocked Angel says "Buffy?" and extends his arm, but no help is coming.

... a lace-gloved feminine hand slips into his. "Such    a pretty house you have, sweet William. It smells of Daffodils... and Viscera"    says Drusilla as Spike/William slowly raises up from the chair in the old drawing    room and begins to dance with his Sire. William now has a slightly different    aura about him, being a little more confident, not as "wussy." Wanting    to give the home a final goodbye, William and Drusilla lay on the couch and    start necking, with William talking of grand scemes of murder and mayhem, saying    the three of them will cause much carnage. Drusilla questions "Three of    us?" William states almost matter of factly him, her, and his mother, then    continues with the gloating talk.

The next day, Giles tells the others that he believes the ghost is Jenny. They don't see how the pieces fit, but Giles remains set in his belief. In the computer classroom, Willow looks up any previous shooting victims in the school. She finds a record from 1955, when a student shot his teacher, then himself. Buffy recognizes the faces from her dream, so she grabs a 1955 yearbook and looks them up. The boy was James Stanley, and his teacher was Grace Newman. Buffy determines that they were having an affair. However, Buffy feels no remorse for James's fate, for she feels he deserved whatever punishment there was after shooting Grace. In the cafeteria, Cordy complains about the upcoming Sadie Hawkins dance when another paranormal event occurs. This time, all of the food transforms into snakes, sending the entire school population into panic. One of the snake bites Cordy's cheek before she swats it away. After they evacuate the school, a team is sent in to clean out the snakes. Principal Snyder talks with his friend on the police force, Bob. Snyder knows that they're on a Hellmouth, but Bob demands Snyder to control the situation, otherwise the mayor would have to get involved. That night, Willow sets up a plan to exorcise the spirit from the school. To do so, Buffy, Xander, Cordelia, and herself need to chant from different locations in the school at midnight, forming what is called a Mangus Tripod. Buffy elects to take the center position, since that is where the most danger would likely occur. After they split up in the school, Willow runs into Giles by the library. He is trying to contact Jenny's spirit, so Willow leaves him alone. As midnight approaches, Buffy sees a vision of James dancing with Grace in the band room. Cordelia inspects her wound in the bathroom mirror, then watches in horror as the whole side of her face turns red and swollen.

Buffy recognizes the bespectacled Dalton from Spike's crew, but only has time for one taunt before the fight is on. She stakes one of the other vamps and, while she engages with a second, Dalton runs away - empty handed. Intercut with glimpses of Angel and the Scoobies hiding and waiting impatiently for their guest of honor to arrive, Buffy and the last vamp struggle hand-to-hand, then crash through a smoky window into what turns out to be the very back room at The Bronze where her friends are just deciding to abandon stealth in order to investigate sounds of battle coming from outside. With the battle abruptly inside, Oz - getting his first exposure to slayage as Buffy dusts her opponent with a handy drumstick - negotiates an abrupt expansion of his worldview with Oz-like equanimity. While the friends bring each other current, Jenny (apparently truly detailed by the gang to ferry Buffy to the party) brings in the oddly-shaped crate left behind by Spike's vamps. Buffy, Angel and Giles immediately open it. Inside, to the puzzlement of all, they find an armored, gauntlet, severed arm, which promptly comes alive and tries to strangle the Slayer. After prying Buffy loose, Angel explains his grim suspicion that Dru is attempting to bring back a powerful demon called the Judge, whose purpose is to rid the world of "the plague of humanity" by "burning the righteous down," leaving only evil demons alive. Recognizing Angel's account, Giles further explains that the Judge could not be killed, even by an entire army, and was only neutralized by being dismembered, with the pieces scattered to "every corner of the earth." Angel warns that if Spike and Dru succeed, reassembling the Judge will "bring forth Armageddon." Immediately, Giles says they must get the arm out of town and Jenny quickly chimes in "Angel should go." Without thought or hesitation, Angel accepts the mission to take the Judge's arm to "the remotest region possible," a trip that could take months. Buffy is frantic. Jenny tells Angel "I'll drive you to the docks."

Episode Synopsis by: Alan Hufana
|
Still nighttime and Buffy is outside, piling dirt on a fresh-layed    grave by lantern-light in a lightly wooded area somewhere. She shovels the dirt    onto the grave which lays next to another somewhat fresh dirt mound (Annabelle?).    She looks tired and down.
|
The ground stops shaking. Andrew comforts Xander by lying to him, saying that Anya died saving his life; Xander smiles, "That's my girl: always doing the stupid thing." While a few of the new Slayers tend to the wounded, the other survivors look back at the crater's rim.
|
The next morning, the gang stages an intervention with Buffy. Both Xander and Cordelia are openly hostile about Angel and see him as a serious threat, unable to separate him from the recent misdeeds of Angelus. Willow is less sure and advises caution, partly motivated by guilt about her own private romantic indiscretions with Xander. Buffy tells them that Angel has the glove and that they are going to destroy it. Giles ultimately comes to Buffy's defense, but in private scolds her for not telling him about Angel's return.

Downstairs, Buffy talks to the gang about Spike's strange behavior. Based on Buffy's information, Xander concludes that some sort of evil is using a trigger to activate Spike's killer instincts.

At the high school, Principal Wood is leaving his office, but curiosity gets the best of him, and he goes into the basement. There, he finds Jonathan's body on top of the seal.

Sid explains that he is a demon hunter, cursed to dummy form until he kills the last of the Brotherhood of Seven: demons who must harvest a heart and a brain to remain in human form.

In walks Andrew, wondering when they're gonna replace the    microwave as he wants to make popcorn, when he sees that something is up and    asks. "Dawns gonna be a Slayer" Anya says. "Holy crap! Plucked    from an ordinary life, handed a destiny..." Andrew starts, before being    cut off by Xander "Say Skywalker and I smack you..." Andrew asks if    Buffy knows, but Xander says no, which has Dawn tell them that she doesn't want    Buffy to know just yet. Dawn then mentions her vision of Joyce from earlier    and says that Buffy may not be so happy to hear such news. Dawn needs to gather    her thoughts and heads up to her room as the remaining Scoobies start talking    about Dawn's new revelations (during which Andrew says gives a "blossoming    womanhood" metaphor, and Xander now offers to pay him to talk about Star    Wars). Anya takes up a more negative view, saying that this has simply bought    Dawn an early death.

Back at The Magic Box, Giles and Tara admire the new phone book advertisement for the magic shop while Anya is disappointed that she is not personally mentioned. Xander complains about Riley destroying the vampire crypt alone, and then the entire gang continues their search for information regarding the beast. Giles agrees that it was reckless on Riley's part while Anya expresses relief that the task was already completed, because she really hadn't wanted to start her day off with a slaughter (which, she notes, "just goes to show how much I've grown!").

Alone in the dark, Buffy tracks Angel to the deserted Bronze and engages him in combat. Angel soon tackles and disarms Buffy, but she retrieves her weapon and fires before he can recover his balance. To Angel's surprise, the Slayer intentionally shoots wide and her bolt thunks into the wall beside his head. When she demands an explanation for his actions, particularly why he spared her but not her mom, Angel mockingly recounts highlights from his Angelus days. When the Slayer asks what changed, Angel more quietly tells her the story of the Kalderash girl he once killed, whose family cursed him in retribution. They gave him a soul that would wrack him with guilt, eternally tormenting him for the evil he had wreaked during a century and more of unbridled vampirism. Angel doesn't try to justify himself, but the Slayer begins to understand that he is unique among vampires, and that this is what she had sensed from the beginning. When he denies biting Joyce, yet confesses wanting to, as well as wanting to kill Buffy herself, the Slayer lays aside her crossbow and slowly offers her throat to a now utterly motionless Angel.

She tries to explain to them that becoming a vampire doesn't mean living eternally, but Ford takes her aside and confides that he has only 6 months to live, and this is the best alternative to death he can find.

Yes,    they're playing Dungeons and Dragons, and Amanda saves the group of adventurers    by having her sorcerer cast a time pause spell and it traps Troglor! "I    used to be a highly respected Watcher, now I'm a wounded dwarf with the mystical    strength of a doily." complains Giles as Amanda wonders who on Earth could    sleep on a night like that. "Only the crazy ones" comments Xander    as the camera pans down to show Anya, sleeping on the end of the dining room    table, head in sleepyland. Xander lovingly scritches her head.

At the library that night, Xander and Giles search for information on Olvikan, knowing the Mayor will transform into it. Cordelia arrives and demands to know what happened between Buffy and Wesley. Giles explains that Buffy has severed ties with the Watcher's Council and no longer needs a watcher, so Wesley will be leaving. Cordelia is unhappy, but Xander reminds her that they're busy trying to avert a massacre, so she agrees to help with research. At the mansion, Willow watches over Angel; delirious, he mistakes her for Buffy and confesses how much he needs and loves her. When Buffy finally returns, she sends Willow and Oz away, then demands Angel drink her blood so that he will be cured. She reasons that if he doesn't completely drain her blood, she could still survive. He weakly refuses, but she strikes him repeatedly to bring out his vampiric side, then pulls his head to her throat. He drinks deeply and cures himself, pulling away when Buffy loses consciousness from loss of blood.

Kennedy explains that she knew she was gay at an early age    as Willow is now at ease with the situation. Willow blushes, saying she doesn't    get why Kennedy is so interested in her. "Have you seen you?" Kennedy    smiles, and then gives a list of similar likes (none of which Willow really    likes), then Kennedy tells Willow why she likes her, remarking that she likes    the way she speaks, her fleckles (which are "lickable"). Kennedy then    admits to not liking the magic "fairy tale" crap, but it matters to    Willow, so it matters to her.

She finds a sweater that she likes and removes it from the closet.

Xander is excited and in shock and Anya chimes in    "wow, it's like one second you were this klutzy teenager with fake memories    and a history of cleptomania and then suddenly, you're a hero... a hero with    a much abbreviated life span." Dawn sits on the couch, trying to collect    herself, as Xander, Willow, and Anya continue their "wow, you're a potential"    spiel.

Willow decides Warren needs to feel what Tara felt when he shot her, multiplied, actually gleefully torturing him. She produces the bullet that she extracted from Buffy at the hospital, and magically penetrates it into Warren's chest in slow-motion. He begs for mercy as she describes the damage of the bullet and what it did to Tara, and when he continues to interrupt her, Willow magically sews his lips shut so she can continue.

When he's free to speak again, Warren apologizes profusely and tries to convince Willow that she's better than this. As Buffy, Anya and Xander arrive at the clearing, an alarmed and unimpressed Willow says "Bored now," and, with a wave of her hand, magically flays Warren's skin from his body from the waist up. She then magically engulfs his dead body in flames and it disintegrates. Buffy, Xander, and even Anya look on in horrified shock at this summary execution as a satisfied Willow proclaims, "One down," before disappearing into thin air.

The next morning, deep beneath the streets of Sunnydale, Spike goes over the city plans, planning his next course of tunneling. Frustrated and bored, Harmony persuades Spike to take her to a party for some fresh food. Later that night, while working a part-time job at Giles' apartment, Xander gets a surprise visit from Anya. Under the impression that they're a couple, Anya tells Xander about his constant presence in her dreams. Shocked and confused, Xander tries to convince Anya that they don't have a relationship. At the party, Parker and Buffy run into Spike and Harmony. After some brief introductions, Spike flees the scene. Buffy follows him outside and gets into a sparring-and-trash-talking session. Harmony arrives shortly, explaining that Drusilla left Spike once again. Before Spike can retreat, Harmony mentions the Gem of Amara. Furious, Spike grabs Harmony and leaves. Buffy heads to the nearest phone and calls Giles to tell him about Spike, Harmony, and the Gem of Amara. Giles describes the gem as "the vampire equivalent of the Holy Grail", but he also explains that it doesn't actually exist. While Buffy heads back inside to find Parker, Anya visits Xander once again, this time in the basement of his house. When Xander reaches into the fridge to offer her a drink, Anya drops her dress to the floor while his back is turned. Paralyzed by what he sees after turning back around, Xander can only listen as Anya describes her plan to get him out of her mind once and for all: to have sexual intercourse with him. Xander tries to resist, but he soon crumbles and gives in to Anya's demands. Back at the party, Parker talks to Buffy about his beliefs on fate. Going with her instincts, Buffy passionately kisses Parker, then follows him back to his room for the night.

When she comes to the area where "Summers" would be, her hand comes across the remains of pages that were torn out. Just then a shadow crosses her face and she looks up to see a Bringer, who waves a knife in her face meanacingly. She turns, paniced, and off in the distance she sees two more Bringers standing inbetween two parked busses, also doing the threatening knife wave. The first Bringer bears down on her as she slumps down against the wall, too scared and shocked to do anything. Suddenly the two distant Bringers are thrown up by something, as if being punched. It's Buffy, coming up from behind and starting to punch and kick them. The first Bringer rushes to the attack as the other two fight with her inbetween the busses. She quickly dispatches them with punches, kicks, and then their own daggers, then turns her attention to the first Bringer, who turns and runs in panic. "Hey! Try picking on someone my own size!" Buffy yells after the fleeing figure as she takes one of the dead Bringers curved daggers and throws it, planting it square in the first Bringer's back. Dead.

Principal Wood introduces Buffy to her office (more like an open cubicle) and talks to her about her job. He explains that she's not supposed to counsel, but more just listen and talk to the students. Buffy's eyes light up with an idea "Can I give detention?" (yes, Wood gives her permission). More talk about how to handle the students, with Principal Wood telling a lame old joke. "There's only three things these kids understand: the boot, the bat, and the bastinada..." He chuckles, she doesn't. He is embarassed at the joke's telling, but Buffy gives a dictionary definition of what a bastinada is (some sort of wooden rod?). Buffy then questions why she got this job in the first place, not having any college degree, and only commenting on her sparkling personality and her excellent work at the DoubleMeat Palace (to which Principal Wood mentions he's a vegetarian). Principal Wood simply says he needs someone who understands the students. Two teens who are obviously busted come in and Wood gets called away. Buffy calls after him, saying she'll just look around the place and get aquainted.

|
Buffy's life is further complicated by mounting financial problems, a flooded basement, and a warrior demon out for her blood.
|
A fake demon appears from behind the van and threatens Buffy, but it's beaten down by a staggering drunken kick from the girl while the van drives away. With the use of smoke to confuse the Slayer and vampire, the demon (Jonathan in disguise) runs away. Buffy began to recover from her drunken state and complained to Giles about her life. He consoled her and offered her a check to help pay for all the expenses. Buffy was happy that Giles would always be there, but the look on Giles's face suggested that he might not always be.
|
At work, Buffy receives a call from Willow about the fraternity house and the spider demon. Meanwhile, Halfrek is in Anya's room praising her return to enthusiastic vengeance while Anya is ambivalent and somewhat regretful. Willow barges in and orders Halfrek out. Anya rejects her assistance and considers Willow poorly qualified to judge following her own brush with darkness.Buffy and Xander search the woods for the spider demon and are surprised by it as they inspect another of its victims - the spider nearly kills Buffy before she tosses it and kills it with a handy bit of axe-hurling.

"So what is it?" Dawn asks Buffy the next day. "What?" Buffy asks. "Last night you said you weren't helping Spike out of pity, so what is it?" "That's a good question" Buffy sighs. The two girls are sitting on bleachers at the school the next day in front of football practice. Buffy is confused on trying to explain what the situation is. Dawn asks if Buffy loves Spike. "No, I... I feel for him" she answers. Dawn asks what she means, but does not attack or accuse her sister, saying that she is also genuinely confused and wants to know. "First you say Spike disgusts you but secretly you two are doing it like bunnies, and then Spike says he'd die for you but then he tries to rape you." Buffy tells Dawn Spike now knows what he did was wrong and that's why he went away, but Dawn wonders if having a soul makes him a better man and compares that situation to Xander having a soul yet leaving Anya at the altar, but Xander stil loving her. Dawn continues her confusion rant as Buffy gets up, saying she has to get back to work. Dawn argues after Buffy that nothing makes sense, but then someone down on the field catches her eye. A hunky blonde teen boy who is just getting ready to leave practice. Old 50's style romantic music starts rising in the background as Dawn watches the football player with adoring eyes, seeing him douse his face with water (in slow motion, no less). Dawn is SO drawn to him, her mouth hanging wide open in awe, being pulled towards this boy... litterally losing her balance on the bleachers and falling with a quick yelp!

On the morning of Thanksgiving, Buffy tries to prepare the dinner while Giles and Willow get into an ethical debate over what to do with Hus. Having researched the persecution of the Chumash people nearly two centuries ago, Willow ponders the idea of trying to help Hus in some way. On the other hand, Giles acknowledges the fact that Hus has murdered two innocent people and needs to be stopped. Xander and Anya arrive, arousing numerous questions about his deteriorating health. When Willow and the others conclude that Hus is inflicting that which was done to his people, Xander is diagnosed with the same diseases that befell the Chumash people: malaria, smallpox, syphilis, and so on. Suddenly, another knock at the door concerns the group. Buffy and Giles open the door to find a desperate Spike, who offers information on the Initiative in exchange for shelter and food. After tying Spike to a chair, Buffy sends Willow, Xander and Anya to warn Dean Guerrero of a possible attack.

However, Oz's entire room has been cleared out, leaving nothing but an empty mattress and drawers.

Buffy asks to see the body and when she sees two holes in the neck, she heads for the library. Giles is not surprised by the news, but he is surprised that Buffy wants nothing to do with being a Slayer. She explains that being the Slayer is why she lost everything she valued.

"Willow, use your magic... send it back!" Kennedy    shouts, and Willow says she's trying. She uneasily, shakily, starts a spell    but the demon back-hands her into the wall quickly. Wood instantly grabs throwing    stars and whips them at the demon, but it basically only pissed the demon off    and it attacks Wood, who is batted away easily. "Weapons!" Kennedy    shouts as Dawn throws her a sword, with Dawn grabbing one herself. Both attack    the demon but of course, they're swatted aside easily too. Spike then jumps    the beast from behind as he tells the others to get out. Kennedy asks what he's    gonna do? "What I do best..." Spike starts and the fight ensues. Spike    seems to be winning... for about 7 seconds, before the demon grabs him by the    throat and throws him up and THROUGH the ceiling, up into an upstairs bedroom.    Instantly the demon turns and jumps through a window, running off into the night.

Research leads them to information about the Lowell building, which used to be the old Lowell Home for Children. They find the woman, Genevieve Holt, who ran the children's home and she confesses that she rewarded the children when they were good and punished them when they were dirty. She'd cut off the hair of the girls who would preen their hair in the mirror in order to "remove the temptation" of vanity and "baptized" them by holding them under water in a bathtub. After leaving Ms. Holt's place, they conclude that a group of poltergeists is now releasing their pent up sexual energy thanks to the repetitive acts of sex by Buffy and Riley. When Buffy and Riley are drained of all their strength, they will die.

Xander and Willow head to The Bronze, which is now a vampire hangout, complete with humans for them to torture. Heading to the back area, the two speak to their ruler, The Master, who is alive as Buffy was never able to kill him. He picks up a girl he had just tried to feed on, telling them he couldn't because she kept looking at him. He tosses her to Willow, who gleefully picks up where he left off. The Master asks for a report, and Xander tells him of their near-kill before Giles' group, referred to as the "White Hats", stopped them. The Master promises that Giles will soon be dealt with. Xander then mentions that Cordelia mentioned "the slayer." The Master is angry that they let her get away, because she spoke of summoning a Slayer to Sunnydale. He mentions that it's especially important to keep Slayers out with the opening of 'the plant' less than a day away, and orders the two to kill Cordelia or else.

In the upper hallway Kennedy walks quietly as Willow approaches    from behind and asks if she's ok, commenting that she's been quiet since "since    you sucked the life out of me?" Kennedy finishes her statement. Willow    looks at Kennedy and tries to explain that she gets like that when things get    all magic. Kennedy is acting quiet, odd, not quite sure about Willow. She says    she thought it would be cool, but instead it just hurt. Willow apologizes, saying    that she was one of the more powerful people nearby, that that's how "it"    works. Kennedy says she understands, but is still wary, and she says she'll    see Willow in the morning, turning quietly into her room and going to bed.

The next morning, Buffy is back in the comfort of her own bedroom. Xander and Willow are also there, keeping her company while she recovers from her fever again.

A band plays at the Bronze as Kennedy's "thing"    is revealed. Both Kennedy and Willow sit at a table with fruity umbrella drinks    in front of them. Willow questions Kennedy's mission and is a little disgusted    with her. Willow starts to leave but Kennedy talks her back, asking her to stay    and saying "You're sexy when you pout." Willow agrees to stay for    "one drink" as Kennedy opens up the conversation very subtlely by    asking how long Willow has known she's gay? Willow is taken aback, but continues    talking. Willow is uncomfortable discussing her homosexuality, but she does    slowly warm up to Kennedy as the SIT talks about how she likes to try and flirt    and find out if a woman is gay or not. Willow finally admits "Three years    ago, that's when I knew. And it wasn't women, it was... woman. Just one."

On Halloween, Willow dresses like a hoochie mama. Buffy is delighted, but Willow chickens out and is a ghost once again. While Buffy the noblewoman, Willow the ghost, and Xander the soldier are out with their little trick-or-treaters, things start changing, thanks to our chanting costumer, and the three become the characters they were pretending to be. Now that Buffy is no longer the slayer, Spike goes to kill Buffy. Giles figures out that the costume shop is somehow involved, and discovers the chanter -- who is actually an old friend, Ethan. Ethan threatens to reveal secrets about Giles to Sunnydale, but Giles decks him and demands to know how to break the spell. As Giles shatters the statue, as instructed by Ethan, Spike is just about to kill Buffy. In the nick of time, she returns to being Buffy the Vampire Slayer and pummels Spike, who runs off. Once they're finally alone, Buffy tells Angel she dressed like that to please him, but he admits he hated those noblewomen -- he wanted someone exciting and interesting. They make out at last -- who said the undead don't like to have fun on Halloween? The next day, Giles returns to Ethan's store, which is bare except for a note which says, "Be seeing you."

Kicking the metal door in, she walks in looks around the    toarchlit room, then after a while she hears a voice "I've forgotten how    young you would be" an older woman appears from behind a curtain as Buffy    stands at the ready, the scythe in her hands. The woman sees that Buffy has    found the weapon and is pleased. Buffy asks who she is. "One of many. Well,    now I'm alone." Buffy asks if she's a ghost, but the woman says she's very    real, she's just... "well, let's put it this way: i look GOOD for my age."    The woman holds out her hands and says she's been waiting. Buffy cautiously    hands the woman the weapon as the the woman tells that while Buffy pulled it    from the rock, she was one of those who put it there. Buffy asks what it is.    "A weapon... a scythe. Forged in secrecy for one like you who... I'm sorry,    what was your name?" the woman asks. "Buffy." the Slayer answers.    "No, really..." the woman says, which makes Buffy shrug. The woman    says they kept it hidden from the Shadow men, which Buffy relates to, saying    she didn't like them much.

Giles warns Xander and Willow that Buffy's nightmares could be fatal, and they must find her. Willow's attempt leads her into her own nightmare: she is onstage in an opera for which she is woefully unprepared. Xander's search leads him to yet another nightmare: a clown he feared from childhood chases him with a knife. Buffy and the boy manage to escape Ugly Man by literally jumping from school during the day into a cemetery at night. The Master appears and shoves Buffy into an open grave. Willow, Xander and Giles need to find Buffy -- unless Billy is awoken, all reality will become nightmares within hours.

In her journal, Dawn writes about how she really likes Willow and Tara because they are witches, and that casting spells is much cooler than slaying.

As the gang approaches the magic shop, things don't look right.  When they enter, they notice that the place has been ransacked, and Willow trips over the body of the storeowner. Buffy leads an unwilling Dawn out of the store before she sees the body and tells her to wait outside. While Dawn tries to peek through the blinds from the outside, a weird, disheveled man approaches her and asks her what she's doing. Just as Dawn is about to yell for Buffy, he quiets her and tells her that he knows her, knows what she is and that she doesn't belong there. Inside, Buffy and Giles agree that judging by the bite-fest on the victim, more than one vampire was present for the attack, which means that there must be a new fang club about. Willow informs Buffy and Giles that some of the inventory is missing, mostly books including one about the methodology of the vampire slayer. While Buffy is upset about missing a book she was after, Giles is more concerned that there is a pack of vampires interested in learning more about the Slayer, but his attention is diverted when he examines the store's ledger and notices how high the profit margins are. Giles then discovers a shattered showcase and wonders what item was taken. Willow informs him that it was a cheap, ceramic unicorn. As they all agree that the next step would be to find the lair, Giles wonders what kind of unholy creature would fancy a cheap, tasteless statuary.

At that moment, Buffy enters the fray. Her first rush breaks Giles free of Angelus' grasp and sends the vampire crashing backwards. Drusilla and Spike make a strategic exit, not wanting to be involved. Chasing a battered Angelus up onto the catwalk, the Slayer thrashes him nearly to pieces, until he begins to cackle and asks if she's just going to let her "old man" burn. Buffy looks down in horror at the unconscious Giles, now completely surrounded by flames. As Angelus boosts her over the rail and makes his own escape, Buffy jumps down, brings her Watcher to, and half-carries him from the building. Together, they stumble into the dark and Giles shouts in grief-stricken fury, "Why did you come here? This wasn't your fight." The Slayer hauls back and punches him full in the face, shouting, "Are you trying to get yourself killed?" Then Buffy follows him down to kneel on the ground and hold him in her arms, and Giles sobs as if his heart would break. "You can't leave me," she whispers to him, joining him in crying. "I can't do this alone."

Oz initially isn't too worried, assuming that even as a teenager Giles would still be responsible. Buffy and Willow, however, know better and tell him that rather than being responsible Giles was an out-of-control dark magic user.

Xander and a group of obnoxious students start acting strangely after entering a quarantined hyena exhibit at the zoo.
|
At school, Buffy found herself overwhelmed by a class she took with Willow. Buffy later met up with Tara for Art History, but before class began,Warren tags her with a tiny device that caused her to move very slowly in time so everyone else seemed to be moving in fast-forward. Buffy was dazed as the world whizzed around her; when she finally noticed the device Warren planted on her, it self-destructed, putting Buffy back in normal time.
|
Buffy releases her aggressions on a punching bag in the training room until Riley shows up determined to talk to her. He tells her he started his late-night vamp activities because he wanted to know what Buffy felt when she was bitten by Dracula. Riley tells her that the vampires needed him and Buffy didn't. After Buffy tells him that she's given him everything she has, Riley says he doesn't believe her and tells her about the offer to return to the military, and that he is going to leave unless she can convince him not to.

Giles phones Angel and asks to meet with him as soon as possible when Miss Calendar arrives in the library, telling him that she sees apocalyptic portents and demands to know what is happening.

In the school hall, Kevin and Willow promise to help Cordelia set everything up at The Bronze for the dance. Willow sees Xander wallowing in his misery and offers sympathy.

Back at Giles' place, Buffy gets the info on Spike's return from Xander and Giles. Before she can leave, Xander gives Buffy a flare gun which he requisitioned during his military state on Halloween a couple years ago. Xander persuades the reluctant Buffy to signal them if she gets in trouble. Meanwhile, Spike invades Willow's room. Not giving her any chance to escape, Spike throws Willow to the bed and lunges for her neck. However, an intense shock delivered straight to the brain stops Spike every time he tries to bite Willow, keeping her relatively free of harm. After a moment of confusion and consolation, Willow sees her opportunity to stun Spike and get out. Just as she reaches the door, the power is shut down through all of Stevenson Hall. Wearing night vision goggles, Riley, Forrest, and Graham enter the dorm and break the door open. Willow tries to escape, followed by Spike. He tries to sink his fangs into the commandos, but the painful shock keeps him from doing any real damage. In the heat of the battle, a punctured fire extinguisher fills the hall with a thick cloud. Buffy arrives and fires the flare gun, blinding the team through their night vision goggles. With the mask still on and his eyes momentarily blinded, neither Buffy nor Riley can identify each other and as they fight one-on-one. Spike flees, with Forrest and Graham unable to give chase. Unable to subdue his opponent, Riley aborts the mission and takes off with the others.

She looks behind her, then  turning her head, out of nowhere, the UberVamp appears! He snarls and with his  first punch to her chest, Buffy is sent flying a good 6 feet into a cave wall.  The fight begins, and at first it seems somewhat equal, but slowly we learn that  this UberVamp is quick, and strong, and damn good, blocking and dodging every  punch and kick Buffy throws. Buffy gets hit and dive rolls a little distance  away, pulling out a stake. The UberVamp attacks, and Buffy jams the stake in  it's heart. The UberVamp staggers... but doesn't dust! It stands there, grinning  evilly, and looks at Buffy coldly as it pulls out the stake. Buffy's face turns  cold from shock.Commercial Break: The Nissan 350z. Buy it. It's the  coolest car!

Outside, Anya finally arrives in a big, white bunny costume. Unable to find the front door where it's supposed to be, Anya walks around the house and spots a terrified guest screaming through one of the windows.

After locating what he needs, Anya returns to the house with Giles, who employs a chain saw to get them inside. Meanwhile, Willow attempts the guiding spell.

Elsewhere, a door mysteriously lands Buffy in the basement, where she finds herself restrained on the floor by the arms of zombies. As she struggles to break free, Josh appears and taunts her mercilessly. When Buffy finally escapes, she ends up in the attic, where the rest of the party guests shiver in fear.

Giles, packing for a Watchers' retreat, is delighted when he is presented with Buffy's SAT scores. Giles suggests that she has an opportunity to have a first-rate educational experience, and she could leave Sunnydale and her Slayer duties to Faith. He warns her about seeing Angel, and she promises that nothing will happen between them because they're "just friends". Meanwhile, Xander and Willow are second-guessing the bowling date with Oz and Cordelia. Willow is concerned that Oz and Cordelia will notice the attraction between her and Xander, and resists Xander's attempt to kiss her earlobe. She and Xander restate their commitment to avoid physical intimacy with each other. Xander tells her that he wishes that they could just get rid of their feelings of lust.  That night, Spike stands outside Angel's mansion and drunkenly rails at Angel for turning Dru against him, until he passes out in the garden. The next morning, he wakes to find his hand aflame after being exposed to sunlight. He runs around frantically trying to douse his hand and avoid the rising sun, eventually diving into his car to tend to his wound.

Dawn takes part in the cheerleading tryouts held the next day. Her over-exuberant and horrible cheer (which includes the line "We've got a secret weapon and his name is R.J.!") causes her to humiliate and embarrass herself in front of the school, after her attempted cartwheel goes horridly wrong. That night, Buffy tries to comfort her sister through the locked bathroom door as Dawn start weeping about R.J. Buffy is unsuccessful, particularly after her trying to convince Dawn that her "unrequited love" is actually just a teenage crush causes Dawn to whip the door open and scream angrily at her sister.

Angel sheds his dripping coat as soon as they reach his apartment. To alleviate her uncontrollable shaking, he brings Buffy some dry clothes and urges her to get under the covers "just to get warm." Seeming unwilling to let her out of arm's reach, Angel dutifully turns his back as she changes, but starts at her audible wince. Sitting on the bed to inspect the small cut on her back, Angel tenderly slips the camisole strap from her shoulder and tells her it's already healing, then falls silent and still. Unable to resist his proximity, Buffy shivers and leans back, tucking herself into his embrace. In this relative safety, with nowhere else immediately to be, and in reaction to all the stressful events of the past two days, the Slayer quietly begins to weep. Heartbroken, clearly desiring her, Angel simply holds her. Struggling to express her deepest fear, Buffy says "You almost went away today." Shaken, Angel replies "We both did." When he tries again to tell her what he wanted to say on the docks, Buffy sits up and turns to face him in anticipation. "I love you, Buffy," he says, and his voice breaks a little. "I try not to, but I can't stop." Helplessly, she tells him she feels the same way, then passionately kisses him through her tears. Uneasy, Angel pulls back long enough to murmur "Buffy, maybe we shouldn't..." but Buffy puts her finger to his lips and tells him "Don't. Just kiss me." She feels Angel give himself over to her desire as he slowly sinks backward beneath her. Some time later, they lie asleep side by side, Buffy's arm over his chest. Suddenly, Angel sits up with a gasp, then struggles from the bed, all the while thunder and lightening crash outside. Somehow he dresses and stumbles out to the alley, where he collapses in agony, crying Buffy's name. Inside, the Slayer sleeps undisturbed, never hearing as Angel calls her name over and over into the pouring dark.

Spike quickly tracks Buffy down and desperately attempts to get her to talk things over with him, but Buffy makes it very clear that he is no longer a part of her life, and he is to stay away from her and her family and friends from now on.

As he spends time recovering from this, Buffy merely glares at him with disdain before shutting the door in his face.

"Ok, i'll go: R..." Andrew says from the back    seat of Xander's car, but everyone ignores him "it's hard to play Ghost    by yourself." On their way to the desert to find Giles and the SIT's Anya    expresses concern, wondering what they'll find if it was actually the First.    Xander says "Well, he didn't bring them out there to meditate..."    Andrew turns to Dawn and says she's probably glad now that she's not a potential.    Anya says things aren't safe yet, and Xander says they might know they're coming.    Dawn starts to panic a little, saying they dont' have the Slayer or a powerful    witch. "Just a teenager, a powerless former demon, and two big geeks."    quips Anya. They sit in silence at this revelation until Andrew breaks it with    "Ok, licence plate game maybe?"
|
Then Andrew sees through his viewfinder    Buffy, how pulls out the dagger and says "your turn Andrew." Andrew    is suddenly nervous as he puts down the camcorder and starts to walk away from    Buffy, both circling the still glowing Seal. Andrew asks if she wants him to    read what's on the knife while standing on the seal and command it to stop working.    Buffy is getting him nervous, wondering if he really thinks they came there    to talk to the Seal? Andrew says that you can't give it blood, it will open    it, and opening it is bad. Buffy says that Willow did a little research and    it turns out that the blood of the first person to open it, that being Andrew,    could close it. Andrew starts speaking again, playing the tragic hero, over-acting    with a speech about his redemption, but Buffy tells him to stop, saying that    life isn't a story. She says that he turns everything into a story so that no-one    is responsible for having to follow the script. Andrew says he's upset that    he lost his friend. She says he didn't lose his friend, he murdered him. Andrew    is now terrified and says that she doesn't need to kill him, they can all get    through this like she said. Buffy then says that she made it all up. She's tired    of having to make a bunch of speeches where they're all gonna live because they    won't. Good people are going to die, maybe her, maybe him... probably right    now...

That night, before going to bed, Xander ties Spike down to a chair in his bedroom, even though Spike claims he wouldn't want to bite him even if he could. Spike begins an exaggerated imitation of Anya to annoy Xander. Olivia Williams shows up at Giles' apartment, and after some brief talking they get right to kissing.

Glory prepares for the ritual to open the portal, talking to her minions and Dawn, who has no choice but to listen, as she's tied up and gagged. Spike reports that he can't see Glory anywhere, but the gang has a new problem as Buffy has been reduced to a state of catatonia. Spike tries to violently shake Buffy back to normal, which only leads to a fight with Xander, and Willow forces the two guys apart with magic. With Buffy and Giles out of commission, Willow takes command and lays out a plan: the Scoobies will return to Sunnydale, where Xander will take Giles to the hospital, Anya will look after Tara, and Spike will track down Glory while Willow tries to help Buffy. Spike asks what to do if they run into Ben, only for everyone to get confused and tell Spike that Buffy doesn't need a doctor at the moment. Spike tries to remind them that Ben is Glory, and transformed into her right in front of them. However, no-one is able to recall this and seem unable to grasp the idea. Spike then realizes that a spell must be in effect that protects the information that Glory and Ben share a body from humans (being a vampire, Spike is immune).

Buffy witnessed Molly's murder and charges to the attack,    getting a few good hits in on Caleb out of pure anger, and manages to lift him    off his feet and into a barrel with a punch, but then Spike grabs Buffy and    says that they're leaving.

While Giles and Buffy are talking in the cemetery, they become involved in a fight with another vampire. Buffy realizes that Giles has been trying to distract her while Wood kills Spike. She kills the vampire, leaves Giles and rushes to Wood's place. Buffy finds Spike at Wood's place, with Wood badly hurt, but alive. Spike tells her that he gave Wood "a pass" because he killed Wood's mother, but if Wood tries anything again, he'll kill him. Buffy goes inside and tells Wood that she needs Spike alive, and that she has no time for personal vendettas. She promises him that if he tries anything like this again, she'll let Spike kill him. As she walks away, she says she has a mission to win this war - "The mission is what matters" - echoing Robin's mother's words when he was a child.

Warren appears, pacing around Spike: "Of course she won't understand, Sparky. I'm beyond her understanding. She's a girl... she's sugar and spice and everything... useless unless you're baking... I'm more than that. I'm more than flesh..."

I hear the chatter of the bugs/It's they alone will feast."  Dawn has entered and she silently listens to Willow finish the poem. Xander comments that this is real dark. "I don't know" Willow says, a lot of teenagers post some pretty angsty poetry on the web. I even posted a melodramatic love poem or two back in the day." "Love poems?" Xander asks.
|
At the hospital, Buffy is explaining to Xander about his face being bruised or something, everything the doctor told her. Xander says he keeps expecting his senses to improve by fifty percent.

Spike has ideas of his own, and soon has the two loves of his life chained up i06n his crypt, where he presents them both with an ultimatum.
|
Anya then asks Beth and Tara's father what kind of demon Tara is. Their refusal to give a straight answer  arouses Spike's suspicion, so he punches Tara in the nose, activating Spike's chip and proving that Tara is, in fact, human. Spike concludes that the legend of the Maclay women assuming their demonic heritages upon adulthood is just an old family myth maintained by the Maclay males to keep their women frightened and subordinate to them. Bolstered by the knowledge that she is fully human, Tara declares she will stay with her new family, and confidently tells her relatives to leave, which they do after a slight hesitation.

Back at the house, Dawn angrily kicks Buffy's leg for having Xander try to take her away from Sunnydale. Buffy grudgingly allows her to stay. Spike is in the basement, working out his anger on a punching bag with a crude drawing of Angel's face on it. Buffy arrives and sees this, causing her to be irritated, stating they someday she should put them in a room and let them fight out their problems and that she has "had enough jealous vampire crap for one night." He asks for the amulet, whose exchange he had witnessed from the shadows, and she explains that it is very powerful and meant only for a champion. She then hands it to him. Buffy tells Spike coyly that Faith still sleeps in her bedroom and she has nowhere to sleep. Spike says he doesn't want Buffy downstairs with him, because he still has his pride. When Buffy starts to walk upstairs, he says he doesn't have any pride at all when it comes to her and he says she can stay.

Tara takes Willow and Giles to her room to conjure a spell that will distract the poltergeists.  This will buy Xander and Anya enough time to find Riley and Buffy.  While the two Wickens and the Watcher concentrate, the poltergeists of the children suddenly appear around them.  This allows Xander and Anya access to the house through the front door.  As they make their way up the vine-covered staircase towards Riley's room, Willow, Tara and Giles lose the spell and the children disappear.  Xander and Anya are instantly thrown from the staircase to the living room below.  Xander's body is dragged through space to the bathroom.  He is thrown into the bathtub and held underwater as the children appear around the tub looking in at him.  Anya picks herself up and charges back into the vines, even as one tears through her hand.  She fights her way to the bathroom and pulls Xander out of the water.  Together they rush back into the living vines and battle their way through.  The vines coil around them and slash at their faces like a snake pit.  When they finally reach Riley's door and smash it open, Buffy and Riley separate to cover their naked bodies.  This severing of the sexual coupling instantly evicts the poltergeist and causes everything to turn back to normal.  The next day in the cafeteria, Riley and Buffy explain that some supernatural force was driving them to constantly make love and they had no idea what was going on outside the room.   When Willow says how horrible that must have been, Riley and Buffy share a glance of disagreement.

In Ms. Calendar's computer class, Jenny asks Willow to cover for her if she happens to be late the next morning. Willow is delighted to oblige, and immediately begins to worry at the thought of all that could go wrong. Soon, however, she starts to relish the idea of exercising a borrowed power of authority. There's an awkward moment when Buffy and Giles arrive to fetch Willow, but when the girls leave, Giles and Jenny get a moment alone. Hearing that Angelus' "sense of whimsy" has returned and that Giles seeks a spell to revoke the vampire's invitations, Jenny gives him a book she knows he doesn't have. She then takes the opportunity to explain that, as Janna, she was raised by the people Angelus hurt most, and lied to Giles and Buffy because she thought it was the right thing to do. She didn't know she would fall in love with Giles. Seeing his startled face soften, Jenny goes on to say she wants to make everything up to him. His eyes filled with kindness, Giles gently replies that he's not the one Jenny needs to make it up to. Over supper that evening, Joyce asks Buffy to tell her what's wrong, and Buffy decides to give her a sanitized version of the Angel/Angelus saga. Her mom says, "Don't tell me. He's changed. He's not the same guy you fell for," and Buffy brightly replies, "In a nutshell." Buffy further explains that she'll talk to Angelus if he shows up, but that Joyce shouldn't invite him in the house.

Back in the secret Initiative lab, Riley sits bound in a chair, while Professor Walsh prepares him for his 'operation.'  When he tries to talk to her, Forrest informs Riley that she is merely a walking corpse, but that he is more alive than he has ever been, and that Riley will be joining them soon.  As Riley tries to tell him that they will never control him, Professor Walsh injects him with a clear liquid.  Back at Giles' house, Buffy, Willow, Xander and Giles try to figure out how to defeat Adam.  Willow suggests casting a spell to paralyze Adam, but the spell must be recited in Sumerian by an accomplished wicca in close proximity to the subject.  Xander sarcastically surmises that they need someone with the strength and speed of Buffy, the magic expertise of Willow, and the linguistic skills of Giles.  To Xander's surprise, Giles tells him that's exactly what they need.  While they break into the Initiative house, Giles explains to Buffy, Xander and Willow that while an "enjoining" spell is powerful enough to defeat Adam, it is also very dangerous.

Sixteen-year-old Buffy Summers has moved to Sunnydale from L.A., hoping to leave Buffy's troubled past behind. But Sunnydale High librarian Rupert Giles knows who Buffy is: she is the Slayer, the one girl in all the world with the strength and skill to hunt and kill vampires. He knows about her past because he is her new Watcher -- the person whose destiny it is to train and guide Slayers on their path. Buffy quickly makes two friends: the shy, bookish Willow, and the goofy but lovable Xander, who is instantly attracted to Buffy.

Just then Kennedy has a request: weapons. She's wondering  why the SIT's can't use weapons. Annabelle says that they'll get weapons when  the Slayer says they're ready. Molly says she's ready, but Annabelle says she's  scared. Kennedy says she knows what could help: Weapons! She says they're  sitting ducks without them. Annabelle says they're safe in the house with the  Slayer. Kennedy retorts that she look around at the house and points out the  boarded up windows. "It'll be coming straight for us" mumbles Annabelle, her  mind changing. "We should load them up Giles." says Buffy and the three SIT's  dash for the weapons chest.

Robin says they have themselves a problem. Giles sighs "Spike"    as Robin says that Spike is a problem if the Trigger is still active. Giles    says it's unlikely that the First would simply forget such a powerful weapon.    Robin continues, recalling the First's words to Andrew about it not being "time"    for Spike yet and that he's still a liability. Robin says something needs to    be done but Giles says that Buffy would never allow it. Robin says that she'd    listen to her watcher, which makes Giles snicker a little, saying he doesn't    understand the Watcher/Slayer relationship. Robin says he does, mentioning to    Giles's suprise that he was raised by a Watcher, a Bernard Crowley. The name    makes Giles put two and two together "You're Nikki Wood's son... Spike    killed your mother." Robin answers Yes to both, but says that Buffy doesn't    know about Spike killing his mother. Giles expresses concern over personal vengence.    "Does it matter? Spike is an instrument of evil." Robin contines,    saying that Spike will be Buffy's undoing and he wants to do what needs to be    done, for the greater good. Giles is listening and is in agreement. "What    exactly do you propose?" Robin says he just needs Buffy away for a few    hours.

Buffy and the gang look back on what's left of Sunnydale, deciding what to do next...

"Johnathan... Andrew... You boys like magic, don't    you?" It's a flashback scene to the Magic Box as Dark Willow faces off    against the two Troika members, but things are a little different, with Andrew    standing confidently up against the black-eyed wiccan as Johnathan cowers behind    him. Dark Willow lets loose with a blast of her black lightning-magic, but Andrew    absorbes it into his hand and waves it away, exclaiming "Haltem!"    Dark Willow smiles evily, not expecting such power. The verbal wit is exchanged    between Dark Willow (actual scenes from Two to Go) and Andrew, with Johnathan    still cowering behind Andrew.

Tired of feeling useless, Dawn convinces Clem to help her find Rack's cloaked           apartment so she can help the gang. Little do they know Willow is headed for the same           destination, jonesing for a fix. When Willow arrives, Rack's demeanor is seductive. "Tell           me, Strawberry," he whispers, "what on this earth do you want?" Willow wants it all: she           sucks the power, as well as the life, out of the pusher. Minutes later, Dawn stumbles on           Rack's body. She turns, screaming, and runs straight into Willow, who looks worse than           ever.

However, he's stopped short when an assistant chides Cordelia for speaking to a friend while on the clock. Cordelia then reveals that because of her father's twelve year long tax fraud, she's now working there to save up for a prom dress on layaway. Her family has no money, nowhere to live, and she can't afford to go to any of the colleges that accepted her. Xander is lost for words, while Cordelia says, dejectedly, that he can now go tell everyone that he now has a one-up on her.

It quickly attacks the tuxedo-wearing man, and leaves.

Spike stakes out the Summers home, carrying around chocolate gift boxes and trying to prove how much he's changed. While listening to one of Spike's stories Dawn figures it out: Spike's tortured relationship with Buffy had moved into the love/hate category. Appalled (and dare we say a bit grossed out) Buffy confronts Spike and the vamp finally confesses his love for her. Bufyf denies him as only a scorned Slayer can and you know that involved verbal and physical kicks to the face. The rejection sends Spike straight into the arms of Drusilla, who just happened to be visiting Sunnydale after a tasty train ride. Dru's game plan was to bring her beloved back to his pre-brainchip ways. Can a vamp hooked on "Passions" return to pillaging the masses? You might think so, but seeking the Slayer's love in return ended up being more important. One fantastic fight later  involving Drusilla, Buffy, Spike and, remember Harmony?  Dru abandons Spike once again. The lovesick boy runs after Buffy, only to have the door shut in his face. So much for a happy Valentine's Day.

Buffy is once again downstairs, addressing the troops. Everyone    is assembled, including the SIT's, scoobies, Faith, Andrew, Wood, and Spike    (24 extra SIT's is what I count... could be more). Buffy says that she hates    the whole situation, that they have to be there, that there's evil, that she    was chosen to fight it. She says she wishes she wasn't chosen, and that she    knows a lot of them wish she hadn't been chosen either, but now is not the time    for wishes, it's now about choices.

At the hospital, the Scooby Gang awaits news from Dr. Aaron Kriegel about Joyce's surgery, and they are all relieved when the surgery is a success. Dawn spends the night with Xander and Anya so that Buffy and Riley can have some private time. With the house to themselves, Buffy and Riley spend a romantic evening together, and Riley commends her on how she remained calm and didn't cry.

Giles discovers a powerful demon, Barvain, is about to rise, and calls Buffy, but Willow informs him that she is with Professor Walsh.

As Buffy goes to sleep, Sid waits until the lights are off and sneaks into her room. When she wakes up, he quickly scampers out. Naturally, Buffy has a hard time convincing the Scoobies that Sid broke into her room. Giles, on his part, suggests that the demon responsible might be needing the heart (and later, a brain) to keep a human guise, which means the demon could be anyone, once again. When a teacher confiscates Sid, Xander steals him so that Buffy can talk to Morgan alone. As Buffy searches for Morgan backstage, Snyder is again displeased with her being where he does not think she belongs. In the library, just as Willow finds references to another possible explanation-animated dummies might harvest organs to become humans-Sid is gone when Xander stops paying any attention to him. Buffy finds Morgan's body, missing a brain, just as a chandelier falls on her. When she wakes up, Sid attacks her, and during their fight, they realize they are both working for the same goal: to stop the demon.

Buffy remarks how much he's changed with the demon face and all and the two begin to "chat." Buffy asks what he's been up to. He says, besides dying, majoring in psych, doing an internship at Sunnydale mental hospital, then he asks if Buffy remembers "Crazy Jay." Buffy says yes.

The students of Sunnydale High school are spending the afternoon at the zoo. Besides the standard zoo animals, this facility has a special new hyena exhibit, marked "Positively No Admittance." This piques the interest of Sunnydale's obnoxious cool crowd, who have already had their fun tormenting Buffy and a shy, bookish student named Lance. After grabbing poor Lance's notebook, they enter the forbidden hyena house, forcing him to follow. Xander, worried about his timid classmate, decides to come to his rescue. As they wait for Xander, Buffy and Willow meet an eccentric zookeeper, who claims the hyenas can understand human speech -- they learn people's names, call out to them, and then eat them. Meanwhile, the crowd in the hyena house starts to get rough with Lance, but suddenly their eyes start flashing yellow -- apparently, they've stepped into a mystical circle on the floor and a transformation has taken place. We see the eyes of one student who never meant to be there, and they're flashing yellow, too. It's Xander.

With the mud on her hands, the only thing she knows to do is spread it across her face.  As her mask nears completion, Riley interrupts her, telling her that now that she is not looking for her friends, she must go it alone.  He leaves, and the sun bursts into the room, and Buffy walks out into the same arid dessert that she appeared in before.  Tara comes out to speak for the creature, a primitive young woman who Tara identifies as the first Slayer.  She professes that Slayers do not walk on the earth, and work alone, only to slay.  Buffy tells her that times have changed, that she needs her friends and that she wants them back.  The man with the cheese pops in without saying a word, and Buffy says that she's just going to wake up.  With those words, the two Slayers engage in furiously fast fight.  As they roll down a huge embankment, Buffy shouts out that the fight is OVER and wakes up out of her dream in her living room.  As she gets up, the first Slayer jumps at her, and she realizes she is not out yet.  The Slayer tries to stab her but Buffy just ignores her and sits down on the couch.

Later Giles confronts Buffy telling her he believed she made the wrong choice in deciding to get the chip removed, as he considers Spike to be too much of a loose cannon.

Buffy tells Giles she trusts Spike now that he has a soul, but Giles tells her he thinks she's making bad decisions where Spike is concerned due to their past relationship, reminding her she's putting a lot of lives on the line for him.

Dawn now asks    Amanda if she's ok and Amanda, not noticing the scar before, is a little nervous    and shaken, not knowing what to say. Dawn is caring and asks further, even to    Amanda's saying that she probably won't believe her. Amanda tells that she was    at school late for swing choir and having ripped her uniform, she went to home    ec to sew it up. Even later, everyone had since left and the place was spooky    when this guy or "thing" attacked her and scratched her. Dawn asks    further and wonders if this "thing" scratched her with it's teeth?    "Was it real? Was it really a Vampire?" Amanda asks. Dawn of course    comforts her and says she believes her. Amanda says after a brief struggle it    hit it's head and she trapped it in a room at the school, and she thought about    maybe getting Buffy because she's heard that she deals with this kind of thing    and can help. Dawn says that they can't get a hold of Buffy, but they can handle    it themselves.

We always thought they were around to help, but those pesky fellas from the Watcher's Council have been nothing but badness of late. The limeys return to Sunnydale, demanding the Slayer pass an exhaustive review of her slaying skills. To make matters worse, they plan to withhold crucial information about that creature Glory as well as deport Giles back to England if Buffy does not play along. Speaking of Glory, guess who still wants that key? As Buffy tries to live up to the Council's demands, Glory pays a visit to the Summers household to have a chat about coming to a friendly agreement: give up the key and I won't kill everyone you love in front of your eyes. She's such a softy. The Council begins interrogating the Scooby Gang about the Slayer and Buffy takes Joyce and Dawn to the only safe places she can think of: Spike's. Late for a brain-probing date with those stuffy English guys, Buffy runs into some creepy knights, sent to destroy the Slayer and the key to prevent Glory from getting her manicured nails on it.

She sends the knights on their merry way and confronts the Watcher's Council  she has all the power, she has what everyone wants, they are there to assist her.

After spending the summer with her dad in L.A., Buffy returns to Sunnydale, well, very unsunny.

And to make matters worse, the Master is not quite as dead as everyone had hoped. His minions assemble with the Anointed One and plan to try to bring the Master back. This can be done by assembling those who were with him when he died -- Willow, Cordelia, Giles, and Ms. Calendar, the computer teacher who Giles is stuck on. Angel warns Buffy about the Anointed One's powers, but she ignores him. Besides being rude to Angel and nasty to Cordelia, she is cold to Willow and Xander. She even tries to make Angel jealous by dancing seductively with poor Xander, who buys her act. Xander finally tells Buffy off when the vampires beat him up and start assembling the foursome they need for their mission. Buffy rescues Willow, Cordelia, Giles and Ms. Calendar, who are hung upside down and about to be killed. In order to finish off the Master, Buffy crushes his bones. After this final act, Buffy is purged of her fear and anger and starts sobbing as Angel holds her. The next day at school, she apologizes to Giles for behaving so badly, and is mortified when she realizes how rotten she's been to her friends.

But of  course, being Dawn, she stands too close and the figure takes her down with a  foot sweep. The figure is over her and pulls a knife, ready to strike, just as a  large THUNK is heard. The robed dude falls unconscous, with Xander standing  behind holding a large pipe-stick-thing.

Deep in concentration during a training session at Giles' house, Buffy executes a very difficult one-handed handstand. Below her lies a neatly stacked pile of crystals. Dawn, Buffy's newly arrived younger sister, carelessly adds another crystal to the pile, causing them to topple. This disrupts Buffy's concentration and she falls flat on her back. As a surprised Buffy looks up, Dawn asks smartly if they can leave.

While trying to get a loan, Buffy runs afoul of three deadbeat sorcerers who are using the otherworldly powers of a demon to rob a bank.

Back at the Summers home, down on    Spike's cot in the basement, lay Xander and Anya. Yep, they just "did it."    They both comment on how good it was, and feel sorry that Buffy took Spike's    chains down from the wall. But they both talk and both feel like this was a    "one more time", feeling that the relationship just isn't there anymore.
|
Willow walks in from upstairs having just come from an apparently    sick Kennedy, who is "flu-ey" and won't be attending the Vision quest.    Xander then barges in the front door, telling Giles he'd better get out to the    car, as the SIT's are arguing over who gets to drive the first leg of the trip    (apparently Giles didn't renew his California drivers license?). Anya then walks    in saying that Rona won (by stuffing Molly in the trunk!). Giles tells Buffy    to be safe while he's away. "You too..." smirks Buffy behind him.

Armed with only stun gun, Buffy, Xander, Willow and Giles run through the main operations room of the Initiative, knocking demons out of their way right and left.  Willow narrowly misses being shot by a panicking Initiative soldier, and Xander saves Buffy by blasting a demon with the stun gun.  Miraculously, they make it through the explosive battle unscathed, and enter into a small laboratory.  They move a cabinet in the corner to reveal a secret door that leads to Adam's secret lab.  Buffy pauses at the door and tells Willow to barricade the door behind her.  Xander tells Buffy that he is still uneasy about Buffy going in alone, but Buffy assures him that with the magic spell, she will not be going in alone.  With that, Buffy goes in, and Willow barricades the door.  When Buffy enters the secret lab, she finds Riley bound in his chair.  She asks Riley to tell her what is going on, but he is unable to speak.  Adam comes out from the shadows and orders Forrest, Professor Walsh and Dr. Angleman to kill Buffy.  Forrest grabs Buffy from behind and Walsh approaches with a medical saw.

Cordelia spots Xander walking towards her and asks a random jock named John Lee to come near her. She actually asks if she has anything in her teeth, but she makes it appear that, from Xander's point of view, the two are kissing. As Xander sadly walks away, John Lee tells Cordelia that he can't risk being caught speaking to "Xander Harris' cast-off" and quickly leaves. She tries to come to terms with the fact that her standing in the school is at rock bottom.

The next morning, Cordelia exemplifies the denial most Sunnydale residents undergo after paranormal encounters. Giles warns the budding gang of more battles ahead, which they accept more nonchalantly than he would like as Buffy, Willow and Xander go off and discuss to see how Buffy could get herself get kicked out of school while Giles looks on after them as they walk on, while saying to himself: "The Earth is doomed."

Later that night, as Angelus' voice imparts the epilogue of his "passion" drama, Giles comes home to a very normal-seeming, brightly lit apartment building. Reaching his front door, however, instead of a rose, he finds yellow crime scene tape. Now silent and dark, his apartment only seems emptier. As the scene changes to a daytime view of grass, shrubs and a small leaf-strewn pond, Angelus' narration comes to an end with Giles and Buffy standing beside a new grave. Its simple headstone reads "Jennifer Calendar" in elegant brass letters. Laying down a bouquet of flowers, Giles murmurs a few simple words and Buffy's eyes fill with tears. She apologizes aloud for not being able to kill Angelus when she had the chance. A moment later, her quiet voice says: "I wasn't ready." The scene changes again, and as Willow comes to stand in front of Jenny's desk, Buffy's voice says, "But I think I finally am." Holding an armload of books and printout, Willow gravely announces that, in Ms. Calendar's absence, she has been temporarily assigned to teach the class. As Willow moves around behind Jenny's desk, we again hear Buffy's quiet voice. "I can't hold onto the past anymore," she explains. "Angel is gone. Nothing's ever going to bring him back." As Willow sets her books on the desk, the backup disk Jenny created slides inconspicuously from a stack of papers and, with a nearly inaudible click, falls into the narrow darkness between the desk and a filing cabinet...

Angelus appears in the halls as Buffy, now possessed by James, talks to him as if he were Grace. They continue the ghosts' argument with Angelus possessed by Grace's spirit, the two lovers speaking lines relevant to both couples. At the climax, Buffy pulls out a gun and shoots Angelus. He falls off of the balcony as though dead. Buffy, still possessed by James' ghost, rushes off to the music room where James killed himself. Angelus, still possessed by Grace, is not killed by the bullets, as vampires are immune. He wakes up and runs to the music room just in time to stop "Buffy" from pulling the trigger. Grace tells James she never stopped loving him, that she knows it was an accident that the gun went off, and that it wasn't his fault. She says she loved him with her last breath. They exchange apologies and kiss passionately. The spirits, now able to pass on, leave the bodies of Angel and Buffy, who break away from the kiss as Angelus realizes what he has been doing. He pushes Buffy aside and rushes off.

As this happens the two demons in the woods summon Taparrich using the Ritual of Mok'tagar. Simultaneously Giles realizes that Buffy was right, using the toenail clippings as evidence. He tells Willow, Oz, and Xander that the Mok'tagar are trans-dimensional demons and the ritual Buffy described in her dreams is used to steal someone's soul. Mok'tagar can recognize their own kind by the lack of a soul. Kathy tells Buffy that she left her dimension without permission to attend college and fears that her family of demons will come to take her back. So she wanted to "borrow" Buffy's soul so that when the Mok'tagar came looking, Buffy would be the one without a soul and they would take her instead of Kathy.

At the conclusion of their kiss, Buffy takes a second to bask in Angel's presence before asking him why he traveled to Sunnydale. Angel tells her he has all the information on what's been happening, and knows that the First is responsible. Buffy tells him that this time it's plans are more ambitious than there were during Angel's last encounter with it as now its raising an army. Before Angel can respond, Angel is knocked out by Caleb, who survived his stab wound and is now bleeding black blood from his mouth and eyes.

Buffy and Giles explain that there is no limit to the amount of damage a demon on the Internet can do. After they find Dave's body, Xander and Buffy go to Willow's house, and Buffy tells Giles to ask Ms. Calendar for help, hoping that between his knowledge of demons and her knowledge of computers, they can re-imprison Moloch. Willow is kidnapped by Fritz. At the library, Giles is surprised that Ms. Calendar understands and even names a few mischief demons, as she is a technopagan. Buffy and Xander, guessing that Moloch had Willow kidnapped, rush off to CRD. Buffy calls Giles, and they co-ordinate plans. Inside CRD, Moloch's robotic body is prepared, and he is happy to see Willow. Moloch kills Fritz as a demonstration of his power. Buffy and Xander break into CRD as Giles and Ms. Calendar start preparing the binding spell. The binding spell does not complete but casts Moloch out of the Internet and traps him inside his robotic body. Moloch crashes through a wall and backhands Xander, but Willow hits Moloch with a fire extinguisher. As Moloch tries to kill Buffy, he punches an electrical power line and dies.

At Professor Worth's apartment, Buffy is investigating, trying to find some information that may be helpful, and Angel comes to help her out.  They gather a box of documents, and prepare to take it to Giles.  Outside the professor's apartment, Buffy and Angel talk about their relationship, and Buffy expresses her frustration.  Suddenly an arrow pierces Angel through the back.  We see that Faith has shot the arrow.  When Buffy tries to help Angel up, he collapses; he's sweating, burning up.  The arrow is poisoned, he tells her.  In a panic, Buffy rushes Angel back to the library.
|
"No skin" Buffy and Xander look down at the body. Xander had found the body first thing that morning and gave his crew the day off, then called Buffy right away. "I've gotta get a job where I don't get called right away for this stuff." Xander hears a noise nearby, glancing at a ladder. Willow is seen climbing up the ladder with a shocked look on her face. Xander says "Yeah, I know exactly what you're thinking... Maybe Willow IS back."
|
Meanwhile, Willow confronts Parker with what she says he has done to Buffy. He turns his charm on her, and she seems to be swayed by it, but then she reveals she has been playing along with a rant about how primitive men are - just when the four Neanderthal students burst into the room. They knock Willow and Parker unconscious and start a fire that rapidly burns out of control. Xander catches up with Buffy and when they see smoke from the Neanderthals' fire, they rush to help.

Buffy is still thinking about dealing with the Mayor, but her future is weighing heavy in her mind as well.  She tells Willow that she feels she'll never get out of Sunnydale.  Willow, though, says that might not be so bad - she's decided to stay at home and go to UC-Sunnydale, and so they'll be able to stay together as friends.  Willow explains that she realized she wants to fight evil, and help people, and she feels she can do that best in Sunnydale, which is why she wants to stay.  It's a good fight they're fighting, and she wants to keep fighting it.

Buffy feels life spinning out of control. In the previous episode, Willow got high on the magic  and crashed a car, breaking Dawn's arm. Willow is still distraught. Dawn is ignoring Buffy and resents her because Buffy was off secretly having sex with Spike during the crisis, so the younger Summers is only talking to Xander. Dawn is further irritated because Buffy is gathering up everything in the household even slightly magical and hiding it so Willow can avoid magical temptation, including a statue of the Hopi god Kokopelli, which Dawn treasures because it belonged to their late mother, Joyce.

Faith sits on the porch and smokes as Robin arrives for the Scoobies meeting. They talk about Faith's newly acquired bruises and the issues they both have. Spike leads the way into the church with Andrew and they're attacked by a man bearing Caleb's burn mark on his face. Back at the house, Xander is guided inside and welcomed by his friends and the Potentials. Buffy talks to the whole group about what she's found out and announces that they need to go back to the cellar at the Vineyard, an idea which everyone else is naturally horrified at, given what happened the previous time. Spike interrogates the man, a preacher, and persuades him to help them. The preacher shows Spike and Andrew about a secret room inside the church with words on the wall, - words that angered Caleb once he read them. Spike translates the words from the original Latin as they reference something that is only for "her" to hold.  Buffy continues to argue her point and the reasoning that Caleb is protecting something crucial at the Vineyard, but no one agrees with her. Faith and Giles express their logical opposition and the Potentials jump in with attacks of Buffy's decisions. Willow questions Buffy's judgment and Anya informs Buffy how her "Slayer" powers don't earn her the right to be the sole leader, they just makes her more fortunate than the rest of them. Buffy stresses that she's the one in charge who has to make the decisions regardless of their opinions on the situation. Everyone else disagrees, and the idea is raised that Faith is a Slayer, too - and maybe they should vote on who the leader is. Faith rejects the idea of taking over command, but questions whether Buffy could actually handle someone else taking the lead. Even Xander expresses his displeasure with Buffy's point of view. Buffy refuses to go along with the others, and so Dawn stands up and regretfully asks Buffy to leave, since she's unable to accept the overwhelming vote of everyone else. Emotionally wounded by the rejection, Buffy leaves in tears. Faith follows Buffy outside and tries to let Buffy know this wasn't her idea. Buffy simply lets Faith know that it's her responsibility now and asks Faith to take care of them all.

The news horrifies everyone -- Principle Flutie has been eaten! The "official" story is that a pack of wild dogs did it, but Buffy, Willow and Giles know the truth. Since Xander was with Buffy when the incident occurred, she is relieved that he was not involved. Giles has figured out that in order to restore order, the spirits of the hyenas must be taken from the students and put back into the animals. While Buffy and Giles go to the zoo, Willow offers to watch over Xander. The zookeeper, well-versed in these matters, offers to help with the "transformation," and says that all the students must return to the mystical circle in the hyena cage. But one member of their pack is missing -- Xander -- and Buffy and Giles realize, to their horror, that they will seek him out, leaving Willow vulnerable to their attack. When they do just that, Xander breaks free from the cage, but Willow hides. They escape the school grounds and Buffy leads them all to the zoo.

Dawn looks at the glowing white figure of her mother. "Things are coming, Dawn, things are on their way. Listen, I love you and i love Buffy, but she won't be there for you. When it's bad, Buffy won't choose you. She'll be against you." Joyce's image then slowly fades away with Dawn wondering what she means and pleading for her mother to stay. Dawn then collapses on the ground crying amidst the messy room.

The following day Buffy explains the dream to Giles, Oz and Willow. Willow also becomes concerned with Buffy's actions and attitude towards Kathy, so Oz agrees to go patrolling with her later that night. That night, the two demons meet again and one confirms that "she is the one." The group chants around a large fire, preparing to summon "the great Taparrich". Meanwhile, as Buffy returns to her dorm room she is angered to find Kathy and Parker getting along. Buffy makes Parker leave, but tells him they should meet again, before leaving to go and patrol. While talking with Oz, Buffy shows more anger towards Kathy, telling him something has to be done. After going to bed, Buffy has the same unsettling dream.

When he wakes the next morning, Giles discovers he has been transformed into a horned demon with incredible strength. He breaks the phone trying to make a call, then breaks the door off its hinges as he tries to leave the house. At breakfast, Willow lies to Buffy about where she was, saying she was practicing magic alone. She does mention that some magical force interfered with the spell she was attempting to cast. Buffy realizes she never told Giles about Riley and the Initiative. Giles goes to Xander's basement and tries to get him to help, but Xander doesn't recognize and cannot understand Giles, who is speaking in a demonic language. Xander starts to throw things at him and Giles runs away.

An ambulance arrives at the Summers' house and Xander leads them to Buffy's still body. Meanwhile, upstairs, a tearful Willow begs for Tara to return to her and calls upon Osiris to bring Tara back to life. The god denies Willow's request, explaining that the death was natural and human and cannot be undone. The resurrection of Buffy was allowed because her death was the result of mystical forces, but Tara's was a human death, by human means. Devastated and angry, Willow banishes the god with a violent, powerful scream, causing him pain before dismissing him. Xander accompanies the paramedics to their truck out front as a determined Willow exits the house. He tells her Warren shot Buffy, and she leaves on a mission (without revealing what happened to Tara), while Xander joins Buffy in the ambulance.

Willow is increasingly frustrated that Oz shows no sign of wanting to get serious - not to mention physical - with her. Cordelia is frustrated with Xander because he keeps talking about Willow, even while making out in Sunnydale's Lovers' Lane under a full moon. They are attacked by a werewolf that rips a hole in the car's roof. Giles points out that there have been quite a number of other attacks, though so far only animals have been killed.

In Buffy's history class, the teacher is discussing how Rasputin was considered nearly impossible to kill. Buffy challenges the professor to look at the history from a different angle but he shoots her ideas down with scathing criticism and sarcasm, embarrassing her in front of the entire class. That night, Buffy complains about her class to a vampire she's fighting until she is thrown off balance. Spike suddenly appears, flying over a tombstone to tackle and stake the vampire. He expects gratitude from her, but Buffy tells him he is getting in her way. The two then verbally attack each other.
|
The next day, Buffy visits Giles at his apartment. After she describes the demon to Giles, he wonders why Buffy is there instead of at school. Buffy admits that she's staying out of the dorm until Kathy goes to class. Meanwhile, Kathy futilely attempts to remove the stains on her sweater from the previous night. Giving up, she decides to take a look through Buffy's closet. Kathy finds a sweater to her liking, then notices Buffy's weapons bag on the floor of the closet. Later, Buffy cuts into the cafeteria line in an attempt to avoid Kathy, who is standing further down the line. The student whom Buffy cut off, Parker, decides to introduce himself. He gives Buffy a lesson on how to effectively utilize their meal cards. At the end of the line, Parker heads towards his friend's table, while Buffy joins Willow, Oz, and Xander at the other end of the dining room.  During their conversation, Kathy takes it upon herself to join the group at their table, uninvited. Buffy quickly recognizes what Kathy's wearing, who believes that it's only fair since Buffy caused the stains on her own sweater. As Kathy tells the others about herself, Buffy watches in horror as a glob of ketchup falls from Kathy's hamburger onto the sweater. That night, Willow tries to talk on the telephone while her roommate throws a party at the same time. On the other end of the line, Buffy throws out more complaints about her roommate. Hearing Kathy just outside the door, Buffy hangs up. While Kathy sits on the bed and flosses her teeth, Buffy tries to fit her apple into the stuffed fridge, in which every item is labeled with Kathy's name, including each individual egg. When Buffy turns around, she realizes that Kathy has closed her window. Buffy opens it back up and hits the sack. After falling asleep, Buffy has a dream about a demon placing a scorpion on her stomach, pouring blood down her throat, and sucking a mysterious light out of her mouth.

Meanwhile, Spike is watching Dawn when the demon bikers arrive ready to tear Sunnydale apart. Spike recognizes the Hellions and knows they would never have come to Sunnydale if they didn't think it was vulnerable, meaning they know that there's no Slayer. Buffybot comes across the gang and tries to stop them but the leader, Razor, wounds her and she runs away to find Willow. The bikers following her reach the cemetery and interrupt Willow's spell by breaking the Urn of Osiris and scattering the gang's circle. One of the bikers tries to take Anya away, but Tara uses magic to get her back. Xander tells Willow that the spell didn't work, and the two continue to run.
|
Andrew and Spike return and when Spike asks about where Buffy is and when she will return, Willow tries to explain with an embellished version of what happened the previous night. Spike is not convinced that Buffy would "take a time off" during an apocalypse and realizes that the others turned their back on Buffy by kicking her out. Furious over their betrayal, he snaps at them for being ungrateful to Buffy after all that she has done for them. When an unimpressed Faith interrupts his speech, Spike loses his temper and physically attacks her, going so far as to taunt her, claiming that she has always been jealous of Buffy's life and demanding to know where Buffy has gone. After admitting she doesn't know, Faith stands prepared to continue, but Spike has lost interest. Spike then steps outside to catch her trail with his vampire ability to catch scent. He goes in search of Buffy.

Bubbling test-tubes, tons of lab equipment, and scewed    camera angles make up the supervillian scene as Andrew describes his latest    plan to Johnathan and Warren, who both hang on his every word. In a very "Batman-ish"    style, Andrew explains that they're going to make Buffy "super magnetic",    where everything metal will instantly be attracted to her, including knives    and swords! Warren brings up that they may be wearing metal belt buckles. "In    my plan, we are belt-less" Andrew tells them as both practically swoon    over him.

Meanwhile, Giles and Xander find that the Mayor will transform into the demon Olvikan, and find an unseen picture of him in a book - the illustration is four pages long. The Mayor is also alerted to the trouble at Faith's place. On the edge of the roof, Buffy stabs Faith with the knife Faith had received from the Mayor. Faith congratulates Buffy for killing her, punches her to the ground with a brutal back swing, then leaps off the roof onto a truck on the street below, denying Buffy her blood. The fall knocks her out, and Buffy watches as the truck carries her away.

Ending up in the basement laundry room, Willow looks for something to barricade the door. Spotting a vending machine several yards away, she limps over and tries to push it. Even with Tara's help, Willow can't move it very far in her condition. Willow then tries to lift the machine telekinetically, but her limited experience makes the task impossible. Realizing Willow's true capabilities of witchcraft, Tara joins hands with her injured partner. Together, they slam the vending machine up against the door as if it weighed nothing. At Giles' apartment, a slight misunderstanding and a large helping of coincidence lead Xander to believe that Spike has just bitten into Anya's neck. As Xander proceeds to land numerous punches on Spike's face, Anya wakes up and shows to Xander that nothing happened. When Xander drops Spike and immediately kisses her, Anya realizes just how much Xander really cares for, putting an end to their little argument.

Spike, cheerfully, says she hit him on the head with an axe once. Both are very happy when Buffy shows up, getting them out of their awkward silence. Buffy says she'll accept Spike's offer, although she is hesitant to let Dru walk because she killed Kendra. Spike expresses surprise and pride that Dru "bagged a Slayer", but then realizes that this is probably not the best thing to say in front of Buffy. He insists that Buffy will get no help from him if Dru is harmed, and she accepts these terms but she warns that Drusilla only walks if Giles survives.

Buffy tells her mom that she wishes she could be a normal teenager, but that she has to go save the world, again. Joyce tells her daughter not to come back if she leaves the house.

An ambulance arrives at the Summers' house and Xander leads them to Buffy's still body. Meanwhile, upstairs, a tearful Willow begs for Tara to return to her and calls upon Osiris to bring Tara back to life. The god denies Willow's request, explaining that the death was natural and human and cannot be undone. The resurrection of Buffy was allowed because her death was the result of mystical forces, but Tara's was a human death, by human means. Devastated and angry, Willow banishes the god with a violent, powerful scream, causing him pain before dismissing him. Xander accompanies the paramedics to their truck out front as a determined Willow exits the house.

At The Bronze, Buffy and Xander blithely dance to sultry music while Angelus darkly watches from across the room. As the weight of his predatory gaze makes everyone seem to move in dreamlike slow motion, Angelus' voice narrates a poetic evocation of the concept of "passion."

Meanwhile, Giles stops by Buffy's house to pick up Jenny's book so he can perform the revoking spell at his house. Upstairs, Joyce talks with Buffy about her irresponsibility. When Giles gets home, he hears opera music playing and finds a rose on his door. He enters and finds chilled wine, glasses, and a note that simply reads "Upstairs". He follows a path of roses up the staircase, but what he finds is everything but romantic. Jenny's dead body lies in his bed, and Giles drops the glasses and wine to the floor. Giles stares blankly ahead as the coroners take Jenny's body out of the house. The cops then ask Giles to come with them to the police station to answer a few questions. Giles asks if he could first use the phone. As the phone rings at Buffy's house, Angel watches from outside, through the windows. He watches Buffy's face as she gives the phone, then slowly collapses against the wall behind her. Willow immediately bursts into tears, and Joyce runs in to console her. After a while of recovery, Xander and Cordy arrive to give Buffy and Willow a lift to Giles' house. At this very moment, Giles stuffs his weapons into a duffel bag and takes off for the factory.

In the Summers home, it's now daytime. We see Andrew sitting  unconscious until SPLASH, a bunch of water hits him dead in the face. A LITTLE  reaction, but not much. Anya and Dawn stand over him with an empty cup. Anya's  bummed it didn't do anything. Dawn suggests maybe using hot water. Buffy walks  into the room and both Anya and Dawn plop onto the couch, trying to act like  they didn't do anything. The act over obvious, saying they weren't doing  anything without Buffy asking. Just then Andrew stirs. "Oh! Look who's awake!"  Comments Dawn. Andrew awakes, choking on water, then seeing Buffy, thanks her  for saving him. Buffy looks at him somewhat uncaring and says that if he doesn't  tell them what they want to know, they're going to offer him to the First for  dinner. "The first what?" Andrew asks, not knowing what they're talking about.  Anya and Dawn explain it to him, but he complains that it doesn't sound very  ominous, "... like Lex or Voldimort..." Buffy interrupts, asking where the seal  is.

"Like Angel?"    Faith asks. "NO! Nothing like Angel." Spike responds, pissed.

Willow's research explains that on the night of the Harvest, the Master Vampire can draw power from one of his minions while it feeds and then can break through from their reality to ours. The minion is called the Vessel, and bears the symbol we saw painted on Luke. Xander guesses the vampires will converge on the Bronze, since it's always filled with young people. That night, a newly confident Jesse strides into the Bronze and hits on Cordelia, who actually allows the former loser to dance with her. Soon, a gang of vampires takes over the club, with Luke at the helm. By the time Buffy, Giles, Xander and Willow get there, the suckfest is in full swing, with the Master gaining strength from each victim. Buffy manages to kill a few other vampires, then Jesse winds up impaling himself on a stake a frightened Xander was holding. Buffy breaks a large window, trying to make Luke think the streetlight is daylight, which will destroy him. He buys it for a second, and she takes advantage of his confusion by driving a stake through his back. Now the Master is too weak to break through to the other side, and Sunnydale has been spared.
|
With Buffy gone, the rest of the gang sit around and debate how they are going to deal now that they don't have Buffy making decisions for them. In the midst of their debating and arguing, the power goes out and Faith concludes the power company has left town and taken the power with them. Meanwhile, Buffy watches as people load up their cars and plan to escape the city, then breaks into a house in search of a place to stay. The owner is still there, but Buffy quietly convinces him it's a smart idea to leave town because nothing in Sunnydale belongs to any of them anymore.
|
More potential slayers arrive in Sunnydale and Buffy's house is overrun with visitors.  Meanwhile, the Ubervamp becomes more of a worry for Buffy as he is still guarding the caves where Spike is kept captive, and it becomes apparent the Ubervamp will be coming  after the young slayer-wannabes at the bidding of the First Evil. Anya and Giles visit an oracle of sorts who they hope will provide them with information on the First and how to defeat it.

China during the Boxer Rebellion, 1900 - Spike fights with a Chinese Slayer, and after a long battle, he kills her when she reaches for her stake that she had dropped during the fight. Drusilla arrives and the two revel in the kill of the Slayer and the taste of her blood (which Spike declares to be a powerful aphrodisiac) before having sex near her body. Outside, Spike and Dru tell Angelus and Darla of the Slayer's death. Angelus's reaction is subdued to the point it borders on disinterest and offers half-hearted congratulations before suggesting they leave soon, as the rebellion is boring him. Spike proudly claims that it was the best night of his life.
|
Willow and Tara reconcile, and Tara tells Willow that Spike and Buffy have been having sex; Buffy stops The Trio when attempting a large-scale theft, but Warren manages to escape with a jetpack. He returns the next day and shoots Buffy and Tara.

They reunite to stop Adam's final scheme to flood the Initiative base with demons and create an army of cyborg creatures like himself - with a mentally controlled Riley set to become one of them. Buffy realises she is not powerful enough to face her enemy alone - but a mysterious spell could give her the edge.
|
At the basement door finally, they    separate, with Buffy and a reluctant Andrew going down into the basement. Andrew    is still in "filming" mode, trying to narrate their decent down the    stairs, before Buffy tells him she's had enough and takes his camera! gasp.    Andrew says he wants to still film things, but Buffy says no, not wanting a    biographer who's a murderer. Andrew says he's not really a murderer and wishes    she wouldnt' keep tossing that word around. Buffy looks at him in surprise as    he tries to explain the influence Warren/The First had on him...
|
At Buffy's 19th birthday party, Giles has a realization. He is an unemployed, middle-aged man hanging around with a bunch of teenagers. He feels even worse when he finds out that he is the only one who doesn't know about Riley and the Initiative. Feeling useless and insecure, he runs into Ethan Rayne, but the confrontation ends in drinks at the local pub rather than the usual fisticuffs. The next morning, Giles looks in the mirror and sees a massive Fyarl demon looking back at him.
|
Willow chases Andrew out of the shop, saying "come back  here!" Andrew stops around the corner, 'Don't kill me!" Willow says she's not  gonna kill him. "Don't torcher me and send me to an eternal pain dimension!"  Andrew then pleads with Willow, saying he didn't kill Tara, it was Warren, and  he was aiming at Buffy anyways. Willow looks a little pissed, saying that's not  helping. He then says she got her revenge by Warren's death, they're even.  Willow gets upset, wondering if Andrew thinks she got some sort of satisfaction  by what she did. Andrew can see that she doesn't, then panics, asking not to  hurt him and saying he's not evil, he's good, he does good things now. "Then,  why do you need lots and lots of blood?" Willow asks. Andrew thinks a moment,  then changes his mind "I am bad, i'm bad, I'm evil, but I'm protected by  powerful forces, forces you can't even begin to imagine, little girl. If you  harm me, you shall know the wrath of he that is darkness and terror. Your blood  will boil and you shall know true suffering. Stand down, she-witch, your defeat  is at hand..." "Shut your mouth..." says Willow as she shoves the geek into the  wall. Willow then gets up in Andrew's face, saying she is a very powerful  "She-Witch" "I am Willow... i am death. If you dare defy me, i shall call down  my fury, wreak fresh vengence, and make your worst fears come through.  OK?"

It is finally removed and flushed down the toilet just in time to save Spike from Riley and his team.   Buffy fights with the two demons, while Professor Walsh watches a screen at the Initiative that is hooked up to the feeds from Buffy's monitor and camera. Buffy fights and the heart monitor loses her heartbeat when she drops it to the ground.

At that point, having killed the two demons, Buffy comes on to the camera feed and informs Walsh that her attempts to kill the Slayer failed. Riley sees this, and then walks out on Walsh, while she's pleading with him to come back.

After researching the resurrection spell, Tara tells Buffy that the spell changed Buffy on a molecular level, just enough to confuse Spike's chip, but didn't make her in any way "wrong."  Buffy is distraught, because she felt this was the only way to explain her recent behavior.  She admits that she and Spike have a sexual relationship.  Though surprised, Tara is supportive and says that it's okay if Buffy loves Spike because Spike loves her-to which Buffy doesn't respond-and it's also okay if she doesn't; Buffy characterizes the latter as "using" Spike, which disgusts her as much as loving him.  Buffy breaks down crying with her head in Tara's lap, begging to be told there's something "wrong" with her.

Meanwhile, Cordelia is dating a fraternity man, Richard -- intrigued mostly by his wealth and society connections. When smarmy Richard comes to pick her up at school, his sweet frat brother, Tom, charms Buffy. But Buffy doesn't want to go to their frat party. As far as she's concerned, she's "seeing" Angel -- if only in the dark. When Buffy tries to get Angel to go out with her, he says their difference in age is a problem, as well as the fact that his demon side tends to take over when he becomes passionate. Dejected, she decides to join Cordelia at the frat party, which requires lying to ever-vigilant Giles about her evening's activities.

Anya finds Willow and asks her to help her with a spell-some dark magic. Willow, eager to do something shocking and unreliable, agrees. The spell involves chicken feet and the ritual pouring of sand over the representation of the object desired to be pulled out of the alternate dimension. The two perform the spell in an empty classroom, and as it's working, several scary images flash before their eyes. Shocked, Willow moves, accidentally spilling some of the ritual sand on herself.

Buffy gets trapped in a net that lifts her to the top of the trees. As she calls for help from Giles, a poacher named Cain appears with a shotgun. After realizing that his catch is not a werewolf, he cuts the net down, and Giles helps Buffy out. Cain explains that he hunts werewolves to make money. He then asks them if they know where else the teenagers might hang out, since werewolves are attracted to sexual heat. Buffy feigns ignorance, so Cain leaves and goes off on his own. Buffy and Giles then drive towards the Bronze, which fits Cain's description perfectly. As they arrive there, dozens of frightened teens evacuate the Bronze, for the werewolf has already arrived. Buffy runs inside by herself and pulls a chain out of her backpack. She tries to tie up the werewolf, but it breaks free of the chain and escapes. While Buffy and Giles deal with Cain, who is upset that she tried to capture it instead of kill it, the werewolf wanders down the alleys when it discovers Theresa's body.

When he criticizes her profession by calling her a killer, Faith finds herself defending what Buffy does.  Confused about why being called a killer offended her, she storms out the door to catch her flight.  At the shipyard, Buffy makes a flight of her own.  When one of the guards reaches a tranquilizer gun into her room, she grabs it with her feet and kicks the guard in the head.  After a couple more slick moves, she jumps into the driver's seat of the armored truck they picked her up in and drives it through the front of the shipyard warehouse.  When she shows up at Giles' house in Faith's body, her ex-Watcher is understandably shocked.  To prove it is her, Buffy lists things that only she could possibly know about Giles, like the fact that he had sex with her mom.  Just then Willow and Tara show up.  They show Buffy and Giles a Katra they conjured which is a small, glowing green orb they have in a charm box.  Willow explains that all they have to do is bring Buffy and Faith together to employ the Katra which will switch their spirits back to their rightful bodies.  Suddenly they notice a breaking newscast on Giles' television.  A group of citizens are being held hostage in a church by unknown assailants.  At the airport, Faith is watching the same newscast.

While Buffy and Faith patrol, Faith starts talking about Angel. The two verbally spar before vampires interrupt. Faith starts beating one into a pulp as two drag Buffy down, mentioning Kakistos as they do so.

She picks up a book from the ground (Greek to English dictionary)    and places it on a table that holds other foreign language books (French, Chinese,    etc...). Upstairs she peeks in a bedroom... more sleeping SIT's crowd the room.    Off in the distance she hears crying and, looking down the hall, sees Chloe    huddled in a corner, weeping. Buffy asks "Chloe? It is Chloe, right?"    as she starts to approach, but she's suddenly broadsided by a figure! Buffy    and the unknown assailant go tumbling down the stairs and Buffy is instantly    overcome and pinned by someone she didn't expect to see: "It's Not Enough"    says the First Slayer...

Without a date of her own, Buffy feels left out as she accompanies the gang to the party. After being swayed from patrolling by Giles, Buffy wears an old Little Red Riding Hood costume, thanks to some last-minute alterations by Joyce. Willow embodies the persona of Joan of Arc in her medieval garb, while Oz completes the picture with his name tag reading "God". Sporting a James Bond-esque tuxedo, Xander tells the others that Anya, whom he invited earlier that day, will be a little late on account of costume-finding difficulty. The gang's stroll to the party is momentarily interrupted by the sudden appearance of masked commandos armed with rifles. They quickly turn and run, leaving the gang to mistake them for average Halloween celebrators. While Buffy and the others make their way to the fraternity house, the guests at the party soon realize that something is obviously not right. Bloody eyeballs, dead guests, and other horrific sights send the partygoers into chaos. In a rush to get away, Josh takes a fatal tumble down the main staircase, snapping his neck at the bottom step.

After Buffy details the events in the sewers, Spike suggests that Riley is probably in on it.  The others offer their own opinions, but Buffy refuses to believe that Riley knew anything about Maggie's plot.  As far as Maggie's reasons go, they surmise that Buffy must have been getting too close to something, such as the significance of 314.  Deciding that all of their lives are in danger from the Initiative, Buffy orders the gang to stay in Xander's place for the time being.  Just as Giles objects to this course of action, Riley arrives at the apartment to see if Buffy is okay.  Buffy tries to explain what happened to her, but Riley has trouble buying the fact that Maggie or the rest of Initiative is hiding something.  However, Spike's presence distracts Riley from the subject at hand.  Finally recognizing the vampire, Riley turns the tables on Buffy, demanding her excuse for harboring a known target of the Initiative.  Spike takes off, leaving Buffy and her friends to focus Riley on the more important matter at hand.  Still in denial, Riley leaves on his own.

Suddenly she finds herself walking through the halls of UC Sunnydale.  As she turns a corner, she is joined by Xander and Oz, who inquire about her choice to take Drama class.  She barely notices Oz, who informs her that he has always been there.  Before she can open her locker, the bell rings, and she goes to class.  She wanders into the backstage of a theater, where a bunch of people are hastily assembling their costumes for a play that is about to start.  An orchestra can be heard tuning behind the curtains.  Dressed as a Swedish mountain girl, Harmony approaches Willow and tells her that she is so excited to start the play.  Buffy comes from behind the curtain, dressed as a 1920's flapper, and tells Willow that her whole family is out in the audience, and they look angry.  A cowboy-clad Riley tells Willow that she could have a better part if she would have arrived on time.

Dawn helps Willow move into her new room at the Summers' house while giving her advice on how to fit in with people at school. Buffy and Xander contribute to the effort as well while talking about Anya. Buffy wonders about Anya's evil intentions, but Xander thinks she's getting better and isn't a threat. Meanwhile, at a fraternity house, dead male bodies litter the room, each one with his heart ripped out. Anya sits on the floor, rhythmically rocking back and forth, covered in blood, apparently in shock from what she's done.  Flashback (in grainy archival footage style) to Sjornjost, Sweden, 880 A.D., a pre-demon Anya, named Aud, cares for her Viking mate Olaf after he returns home from what he claims has been a hard day of fighting trolls, although she doubts him. She waits on him, promising requested sex after he's eaten, and rhapsodizing about "the sense of accomplishment that stems from selflessly giving of yourself to others" and her plan to give away her rabbits to their fellow villagers. She worries obsessively about whether he's unfaithful.

The uncle says it's not fair for Angel to have any happiness, so it's Jenny's duty to keep Buffy away from him. Jenny offers to take Buffy to meet Giles off campus, and they discover some vamps making trouble -- one of whom is the transcriber who once worked for Spike. As Buffy and one of the vamps scuffle, they go flying through the window of the Bronze where the surprise party awaits. Newcomer Oz is startled to see Buffy slay one of them, and now he's officially part of the gang. They open the box the vamps were carrying, and it contains an arm which reaches out and chokes Buffy. Angel explains there was a creature called The Judge who destroyed everyone who was righteous. He was finally dismembered by an army, but his parts still exist, and reassembling him would bring on armaggedon. Angel says he must take that arm to the other side of the world, and must leave by boat immediately. Buffy joins him at the dock to say goodbye, and he gives her a claddagh ring as a token of his love. As they say goodbye, the vamps are back and the arm is stolen.

At the library, Giles and Wesley are discussing why the professor's research was of interest to the Mayor.  He was doing research in old lava beds near a dormant volcano, and he found a large carcass buried underneath by an eruption.  In his paper, Professor Worth suggests that the carcass may be some heretofore-undiscovered dinosaur.  Giles thinks that perhaps it could also be a demon, which would explain why the Mayor would want to keep this kind of information secret  if the carcass was a demon, then it means that the demon can be killed, which would mean that the mayor is only impervious to harm until the Ascension.  Once he's in demon form, he could be killed.

Willow returns home to find Spike keeping a wounded Buffybot out of trouble, the Buffybot having been programmed to return to Willow if damaged. Spike angrily leaves when the Buffybot innocently compliments him on his physique - a programming remnant from her sexbot days - and Buffybot confides in Willow about Spike's constant shame in her presence. Without her real sister, Dawn tries to find comfort from the Buffybot but doesn't get much. The next day, Giles engages the Buffybot in training to make sure she's ok after being damaged. He also attempts to get her to practice her breathing and to release her 'chi', but Anya points out that teaching this to a robot is pointless. Giles realizes he's trying to teach the Buffybot as if she were human, and the Buffybot responds that 'every Slayer needs her Watcher'. Giles notes that, like any good Watcher, he got his slayer killed in the line of duty and that all slayer-watcher relationships end the same way, and now his job is done. The Buffybot innocently asks why Giles is still there, and Giles finds himself unable to come up with a reason.

The Master is displeased that Buffy is killing his vampires, the latest victim being Zachary. Deeming Darla's request to deal with Buffy too personally motivated, the Master decides instead to send the Three, a trio of warrior vampires, to take the Slayer out. The Three ambush Buffy on her way home from pre-fumigation night at The Bronze. Angel, whom Buffy at first suspects is the (only) one stalking her, shows up at a critical moment, but is wounded helping the Slayer break out of a dicey triple hold. Buffy abandons the fight and helps Angel run to her house, where she yells at him to get inside. With the Three safely on the other side of the door, Angel explains that a vampire can't enter someone's home unless invited in. Buffy recalls hearing that, but tells Angel she's never had to put it to the test before.
|
Meanwhile, Buffy, rattled after nearly being killed despite having increased her training, does research with Giles to find out how previous Slayers died and what it was that made their last battles special, but they are unable to find any useful information, mostly because past Watchers either found the subject too painful or were killed along with their Slayers. Giles notes that unfortunately it seems there's no one left who has witnessed a Slayer's last battle, but then Buffy realizes she knows someone who can help. She then confronts Spike inhis crypt. When he demands to know what he did, she tells him that she wants to know how he managed to kill two Slayers.

Buffy, now wearing the crucifix Angel gave her when they first met, returns to Whistler to ask him about how to defeat Acathla, who tells her Angelus' blood will send both evil beings back to hell. Blood opens it, blood closes it. He says with great significance that the quicker she kills Angel, the easier it will be. She says it will be no problem-she has already lost everything. After she leaves, Whistler says she's got one more thing to lose. On her way to the mansion, Xander arrives with Willow's message, but decides to tell Buffy that Willow said to "kick his ass" instead of telling her that they are trying to restore Angel's soul. Buffy asks him to free Giles while she deals with Angelus. Chaos reigns inside the mansion as Spike leaves his wheelchair and attacks Angelus with a crowbar, and is subsequently attacked by Drusilla while Xander rescue Giles. During the fight, Angelus recovers before Buffy can defeat his vampire lackey and successfully removes the sword from Acathla. He and Buffy begin to duel, both going for the kill, with Angelus eventually gaining the upper hand. As Acathla starts to awaken, Spike knocks a dismayed Drusilla unconscious and is carrying her from the fray. On his way out, Spike sees Angelus approaching an unarmed Buffy with a sword and believes that Angelus is actually going to kill Buffy. He shrugs, unmoved, and leaves. Angelus notes that Buffy is all alone, with no weapons and no friends. He asks her what is left, and thrusts his sword at her head. Eyes closed, she stops the blade with her hands. She opens up her eyes, and says "me", echoing Whistler's assertion that in the end all she has left is herself. At the same time, a weak Willow is performing the restoration ritual and falls into a trance. Her friends watch in shock and surprise as she starts reciting perfect Romanian.

Giles' past comes back to haunt him when a demon he and Ethan Rayne summoned in their wild days comes looking for them in Sunnydale.
|
After a moment, her gaze refocuses beyond the scrolling paper and she jumps to see Angelus sitting in the dark at the back of her classroom, as if he'd been silently watching her for a long while. Getting to his feet, Angel approaches her desk with mock cheer. He picks up the Orb of Thesulah, ruminates a bit about its purpose, then pitches it against the chalkboard, smashing it to dust. Musing next about the advances in technology over the past two and a half centuries, Angelus pulls her computer, crashing it to the floor, then rips the Ritual of Restoration printout from the printer, tears it in two, and burns the pieces in the small electrical fire on the floor. Finding the door behind her desk inexplicably locked, Jenny tries to dart past Angelus to the room's other door, but he catches her and throws her through it. When she scrambles up and runs, he mocks, "Oh, good. I need to work up an appetite first." Searching for a way out, Jenny finds all the doors in this wing locked and is forced to flee down long passages while Angelus lopes after her. Near the end of her strength, she slams a door in his snarling face, then rams him with a cleaning cart and runs frantically up the stairs. On the floor above, Jenny looks intently for her pursuer to come up behind her, but runs straight into his grasp when he circles around. Chuckling, Angelus softly holds her head in his hands and tells her, "Sorry, Jenny. This is where you get off," snapping her neck with a flourish.

I sit alone and try to love them/I sit alone and laugh.  In the dark basement of the high school, Buffy searches for Spike. She finds him stairing off into the distance, sitting emotionless. Spike says that if he doesn't move, he won't hear the voices. Buffy starts to ask, then plead with him for anything he knows about a girl, Cassie. Spike repeatedly says he can't hear her and tries to ignore her. Buffy asks if there's something evil in the basement, which sends Spike pounding his fists into the walls. "There's evil. Down here. Right here. I'm a bad man. William is a baaaaad man. I hurt the girl." he says as Buffy grabs his arms, stopping his hitting frenzy. "I hurt you Buffy and I will pay. I am paying. Because I hurt the girl." he says, but Buffy says it's not her, she wants to know about Cassie. Buffy is trying to be understanding to Spike, but she is pressed for time and worried. Seeing he can't help, she turns to go, but Spike pleads with her to stay, saying it will help keep him quiet. Buffy decideds it's better if she leaves.

Spike suggests to Xander that they run, with some  sacrificing their lives so the other can escape, but Buffy refuses to let anyone die. The now-revived Gregor taunts Buffy over the dissension in her ranks, but Buffy silences his mockery with a blow to the face, prompting him to be more cooperative. He provides the answers that have eluded the Scoobies since Glory's arrival in Sunnydale; one of three hellgods that ruled over one of the more horrific demon dimensions, Glory's fellow hellgods, fearing her lust for power would drive her to seize the dimension for her own, attacked first. After emerging victorious from the bloody war that ensued, but unable to destroy her, Glory was banished to Earth, to wither and die as a mortal. The magic which would allow Glory to return to her dimension was embodied in the Key, which the Knights sought to destroy but which a sect of monks instead concealed from both Glory and the Knights, hoping to eventually uses the Key's power for good. In the intervening years, both Glory and the Knights have hunted for the monks or the Key, but Glory ultimately found the monks first, who before their deaths, they converted the Key into the form of Dawn, confident Buffy would protect her. The Knights, arriving too late to prevent the monks' deaths, remained in Sunnydale, where they, like Glory, sought to wrest the Key from Buffy's control. Glory's goal is to use Dawn's blood in a ritual to open a portal, allowing her to return to her home dimension and reclaim power.

It's time for Buffy and Angel's first actual date and she's late -- she's been off slaying, while, unbeknownst to her, an undead bystander has videotaped her actions for Spike to study. But other matters need attending to -- Buffy, Willow and Xander have been shanghaied into being trick-or-treat chaperones for Halloween. Buffy's disappointed, as this is the one night she has heard on which the undead like to chill, and she was looking forward to doing nothing. Buffy and Willow realize they know very little about Angel's personal life, and decide to steal Giles' watcher journals. They stumble upon a picture of a beautiful noblewoman from 1775 -- when Angel was 18 -- and Buffy feels extremely inadequate. While costume shopping, Buffy finds a dress just like the one the noblewoman wore. Xander decides to wear army fatigues, and Willow goes for a cheesy ghost costume. Meanwhile, Spike is off watching the video of Buffy and his girlfriend Drusilla predicts Buffy will become weak on Halloween from some new outside force -- the costume salesman, who we see chanting to a statue by candlelight.

Buffy takes a break at her job to talk in private with Tara. While nervously rubbing at her handcuff burned wrists, Buffy reveals that Spike is now able to hurt her, but not other humans. Suspecting that the resurrection spell brought her to life "wrong" but not wanting to take a magic-related problem to Willow, Buffy asks Tara to do some research to see if she can find out just what is "wrong" with her.
|
Willow, meanwhile, has figured out what the poison is  its Latin name translates to "killer of the dead."  Oz finds that the only cure for it is to drain the blood of a slayer.  Buffy has an idea  she'll get Faith's blood, and she'll kill her first if she has to.  No more playing around, she says  she's ready to take on Faith to the death.  Opening the closet in the library, she removes a dagger  the one the Mayor gave Faith, the one Faith used to kill one of the creatures from the Box of Gavroc in the cafeteria when the box was exchanged for Willow  and takes it with her.  Oz and Willow figure out where Faith's apartment is, and Buffy heads there for the confrontation.

Out in the back yard now, Buffy now presents a sight which    impresses Wood: Training SIT's! Kennedy leads in drill-seargent fashion rows    of girls in combat exercises, shouting out different positions of attack and    defense (4 rows of 4 girls, 16 SIT's in formation). We see Roma and Chloe and    Vi and Amanda and Molly and a host of other since unseen girls practicing kicks    and punches in workout sweats. All are professional and serious, but one girl,    Chloe, is a bit off, missing the kicks timing and turning the wrong way. Kennedy    spots a mistake of hers and says hold it, then gets in Chloe's face, telling    her to drop and give her 20 "20 what?" Chloe asks. "Pushups,    maggot!" Kennedy barks, then turns very serious towards Buffy and Wood,    acting very strong for a few moments, before she gets excited at her power,    "loving" her job. Kennedy asks who "the hell" Wood is. Buffy    says he's an Ally. Kennedy then shows off her troops, saying they're ready to    kick some ass. Wood is just a tad skeptical though, saying he doesn't think    the First has an Ass that can be kicked. Amanda then notices Wood and says hi,    thinking it weird seeing him outside of school, but Kennedy turns and snaps    the troops back into order. Buffy looks on but says that Wood is right, they    aren't enough. Wood tells her that they're an impressive bunch of recruits,    which Buffy corrects him in, saying they were chosen, not recruited. Buffy lays    it out, saying "they're not all gonna make it. Some will die and nothing    I can do will stop it.

At the cemetery, Buffy and Jonathan come across Spike, lurking by a tomb.  To extract information from him, Buffy threatens to put an embargo on the butchers that supply Spike with blood.  The reluctant Spike discloses the location of a vampire lair that was recently invaded by something powerful.  Knowing that this is probably the handywork of their demon, the Slayer and the hero leave in pursuit.  Meanwhile, back at Giles', Willow finds Jonathan's symbol in one of the Watcher's medieval tomes.  It says that the bearer of the symbol has performed an augmentation spell, affecting how everyone perceives him or her.  She immediately figures out that Jonathan must have used it to make himself a para-god. It continues that, with the spell, comes a force of evil to counter the power of its conjurer.  The only way to end the spell is to kill its evil spawn.  It dawns on them that the demon Buffy and Jonathan are after is obviously the spinoff of the augmentation spell and Jonathan will probably do anything he can to prevent it from being destroyed.  Meanwhile, in the cavernous lair that Spike pointed them to, Buffy and Jonathan come across the demon.  Rather than helping it kill Buffy, Jonathan realizes that the charade is going to hurt people he actually cares about and helps her fight it.  When it has Buffy on the edge of a vast pit, Jonathan attempts to sacrifice himself, tackling the demon into the pit.  At the last second Buffy catches his ankle as the demon plummets into darkness and Jonathan is returned to his normal self.

On the edge of the cemetery, Giles races to find Dawn. To his surprise, he stumbles on Zack and Janice (who he assumes is Dawn), just as Zack pulls his teeth out of her neck.

Harmony explains that her mother worries when she's late home, and she wants to get back before curfew starts in an hour. Cordelia is confused about the early curfew, and suggests going to The Bronze, which the girls think is a sick joke. Harmony then asks Cordelia if everything is okay, because she's acting strange. Cordelia claims that she's having trouble remembering things, and asks if Xander and Willow are still considered losers. Harmony tells Cordelia that they're both dead, leaving Cordelia shocked.

Dawn's image flashes in and out of pictures around the house. When she enters Dawn's room, Buffy sees Dawn's possessions, bed, desk, and decorations also fading in and out, as well as Dawn herself.

At Giles' place, while they search for answers, Xander finds a TV and turns it on. They watch the news and see that there was a sinkhole caused by the erosion of dirt beneath it. They come to the conclusion that it was Spike's underground digging that caused it. Giles sends Xander to find Buffy while the others will head to the sinkhole.

Andrew then starts to get a little bit... weird. He nonchalantly    asks the First if there's any weaknesses he has. The First questions why he's    asking. Andrew says it's not a big deal, then asks about the First's existance,    thinking it has something to do with the evil impuses in everyone. Johnathan/the    First is suspicous and asks why Andrew's asking so many questions. Andrew is    now very awkward in his answer, clearing his throat a lot, saying that he simply    wants to be better able to serve the First by understanding things better, like    when they're going to kill Buffy. "Are you wearing a wire?" Johnathan/the    First asks.

Xander asks Dawn what the book says. Dawn says that now    it's a little tougher to read as she shows them the book with completely blank    pages. All slowly file into the kitchen as Kennedy says that Willow can just    use her magic, but Willow doesn't know where to begin or what magic to use.    Willow pulls out a first aid kit to bandage Kennedy's wounded wrist as Anya    goes over the choices of possibly risking Willow going "Dark" and    leaving Buffy there. Wood says that they've got to try and get Buffy back, but    Anya remembers the very hurtful "i'm superior" speech of Buffy's and    thinks she should find her own way back. Xander says they have to get Buffy    back because every moment she's not there, the First has an opportunity to attack.    Dawn tries to get organized, asking Willow how another which might begin to    investigate. Willow explains that it's basically physics and a transference    of energy, which gets a scoff from Anya. Willow tells her that magic works of    physics, but Anya says she needs a conduit, some sort of a catalyst. The group    starts to perk up a little at the plan forming as Kennedy says they need an    exchange also, a demon for the Slayer. Wood says they need to find the demon    that appeared and send it back through, dead or alive. "I vote dead."    from the doorway, Spike appears saying he'll handle the demon and tells Willow    to get working on the spell. Kennedy tells Spike that he doesn't look so good    and that last time she saw, the demon kicked his ass. Spike says he can handle    it and starts to head out without a word. Wood asks where he's going, and with    a crack of the neck, Spike says "to get something I need..."

Willow complains about receiving a 740 on Verbal for her SAT's, while Xander notes that her verbal score closely resembles his combined score. Buffy shows up looking shaken; her unexpected SAT score of 1430 has opened up the possibility of a normal life, and she is unsure how to proceed.

Glory wants it so she can get back to her dimension, but if the Key were used, all the gates of all dimensions would open. Dimensions would melt together & the universe would be thrust into chaos, "all dark, forever". (Of course, this is his side of the story). The monks, he says, tried to harness the Key's powers for the forces of light- that they failed & paid with their blood. Later, alone with Ben, the General- not knowing he's Glory- tells him that if he kills Dawn he will save many lives & that "the will of the Beast will fade" (that he'll get the body if he kills Dawn). Still, Ben can't do it. Just after he doesn't seize an a chance to do it, he starts to get that feeling. He yells for Willow to open up a door to the barrier so that he can get out. Before she can, he changes into Glory. She looks at Dawn & says that Ben finally did something right. The General looks at her & says "the Beast", she looks at him & says: "hey, it's Gregor", throws a tire cover at him, nearly cutting him in half, "now it's not." She throws Buffy into Willow who is trying to do a restraining spell, & grabs a hold of Dawn. Running outside, she encounters the magical barrier, breaking it with a fist. The Knights, seeing her, prepare for battle. Buffy runs out as Glory gets out of the barrier which closes up behind Glory. Buffy runs back in to tell Willow to get the barrier down, then runs out after Dawn. In those few seconds she was inside, Glory killed all of the Knights. Buffy looks out onto the field of dead Knights & collapses.

Spike, Anya, and Buffy fight with the demon and yet again, the demon tries to escape into the wall. Buffy uses the sword to stab the demon through the wall, effectively trapping it within the sword and then breaking the metal over her knee.

Andrew walks into a dark, deserted hospital room "Oooh!    This one has oxygen tanks!" Anya says they'd only be good to blow something    big up, like Roy Schieder did in Jaws. "You are the perfect woman"    Andrew says, in awe of Anya's movie knowledge. The two start filling sacks full    of gaze and other medical supplies while they talk about how bad things are    gonna get. Andrew asks why Anya is still sticking around, she could leave very    easily. Anya says she could, and there was an earlier apocolypse where she did    take off, but she says now she's gotten used to being around humans so long    that she just realized how amazingly screwed up they are. She goes off on all    the weird, mixed up things they do to cheat and cause death, yet when it really    matters, humans WILL fight. "They're morons for fighting, but they do.    They never quit." Andrew says that was a beautiful speech, then teases    Anya about loving humans, which makes her get defensive and threatens him if    he tells anyone. Andrew then says he won't get a chance to tell anyways. He's    pretty much reserved himself to enevitable death. "I think I'd like to    finish out as one of those lame humans that's trying to do what's right."    Anya nods in understanding, then Andrew adds "So... Wheelchair fight?"

Giles starts out at a fairground in a family-type situation with his girlfriend Olivia Williams, who is pregnant and pushing a baby stroller, and Buffy acting as if she were a young child. Buffy throws a ball, "staking" a vampire figure in a carnival game and is rewarded with cotton candy. As Giles comments that she will get it all over her face, Buffy turns and her face is now covered in mud. Quicker than the others to understand that something is wrong, Giles confronts Spike, who is posing for a photo-shoot in his crypt, while Olivia sobs. Spike has hired himself out as a carnival sideshow, while the Cheese Man is nearby wearing the slices.

While the rest of the gang escape the soon-to-be-falling building, Riley shows up to help Buffy fight. The third demon makes its way into the Hellmouth and Buffy goes in after it.

Spike tries to figure out how to drive Giles's car while telling Giles of his experiences with Fyarl demons. Apparently they are extremely stupid, love destroying things, and have an ability that Spike describes as 'that thing with the mucus' to spray goo that hardens like rock. Upon spotting Professor Walsh, Giles makes Spike stop the car so he can chase her down the street in return for her comments in their last conversation. Spike gets information out of the waitress that Ethan flirted with, and finds out where he lives. Breaking into the magic shop, Buffy finds a receipt for materials purchased by Ethan Rayne. Trying to escape the commando vehicles chasing after them, demon Giles jumps out of the car while the commandos continue their pursuit on Spike. Spike later crashes the car while trying to get away.

On her way to the Bronze, Sunnydale's hippest (and only) club, Buffy is followed by a handsome, mysterious stranger. He tells her she must be ready for the Harvest, and gives her a small cross. Giles meets her at the Bronze and she tells him about the encounter. Giles convinces her to use her power, and wants her to try to sense if there are any vampires in the room. She does sense one and finds him talking to Willow, but the two have walked away. Trying to catch him unawares, she grabs a makeshift stake, turns a corner and attacks... Cordelia, the snootiest girl in school, who already thought Buffy was a loser for hanging with Willow, and now thinks shes certifiable. We see Jesse, Xander's buddy, chatting with a girl we saw in vampire garb earlier, but who now appears as a normal student, Darla.

Hands raised and bound against a cavern wall, Spike is almost out of it, still cut up and bruised, eye all swollen, no shirt. A Bringer approaches with a knife and pulls back (apparently to just give Spike his daily slashing?), ready to swing.

Alerted, another Bringer comes to attack with a flaming torch as Spike breaks his bonds from the wall and takes him out with one kick.

The body of a dead cheerleader is dug up from the cemetery, and Buffy the Vampire Slayer is officially back in the saddle. Cordelia accidentally stumbles upon a bunch of body parts in a dumpster, and the parts add up to three people -- the dead cheerleader and her two friends who were killed in the same car accident -- only some of the parts are missing. Giles suspects zombie activity, and clues lead to Chris -- a science whiz who's been quiet and withdrawn since his brother Daryl's death. We discover Chris, with his buddy Eric, has been secretly assembling a woman from these body parts for Daryl, so he won't have to be alone through eternity. The only part they don't have yet is a head -- the cheerleader's heads are unusable because the formaldehyde used to preserve dead bodies causes rapid deterioration of brain cells. There are currently three live head donors being considered: Buffy, Willow and Cordelia. Daryl votes for Cordelia, but Chris doesn't want to kill anyone, and Daryl becomes enraged. Meanwhile, Giles is courting Ms. Calendar, and their first official date is to the school's football game. That night, Eric decides to kill Cordelia, since Chris can't bring himself to do the deed, but Buffy arrives just in time to save her. As Buffy struggles with Daryl, a can of gasoline spills. A fire starts and Xander, who has arrived to help, pushes Cordelia to safety. Chris, seeing his headless fiancee is about to perish in the fire, throws himself on top of her and pledges his undying love. Angel and Buffy finally talk things out -- he admits he was jealous of her attention to Xander, and he feels left out of her life since he can only be with her at night. They walk off together as we see Daryl's tombstone.

In the hall, Buffy says "Do not start this by saying you're sorry." "I didn't come here to atone" says Spike.

Warren coaches Andrew on killing a pig, but Andrew lets the pig escape. Instead, he resorts to getting the blood they need from a butcher. At the butcher shop, Andrew orders an array of meats and pig's blood, but as he leaves, he literally runs into Willow, spilling his purchases on the ground. He runs from Willow, but she catches up to him. Willow, knowing Andrew believes she is still "evil", takes advantage of the situation and frightens him. She's able to take him back to Buffy's house, pointing out his suspicious behavior and purchase of animal blood to the rest of the group. Xander and Anya interrogate Andrew while tied to a chair, but he's unable to provide any useful information. After Anya slaps Andrew in the face, Xander drags her out of the room, and, behind closed doors, the two rave about how well their performance with Andrew went.

They follow the vamps, but somehow one gets behind Buffy and attacks before she sees him. Buffy and Ford get separated in the scuffle, each one taking one of the creatures.

After killing her vamp, Buffy finds Ford, who is now alone, asks where the other one went. Ford claims, with surprise and puzzlement, that he has killed it and it turned to dust.

"He was attacked" says Xander as he hangs up the    phone. Xander tells that this Robson guy was attacked by Bringers, and the last    thing he saw before blacking out was a large axe heading for Giles' head while    Giles was helping him. By the time Robson came to, Giles was gone. Anya says    Giles never told them any of this and worried looks come over their faces. Dawn    questions what they're saying, and Anya suggests that it may be the First, as    the First can become any dead being it wants. What better way than to become    the one person Buffy trusts the most? Dawn says there's no way to know for sure,    but Andrew tells them the First can't take corporeal form. "Well, it's    not like Giles hasn't touched anything, right?" Anya points out, but then    starts thinking "Has anyone seen Giles touch anything since he got back?"    A pause, and worried looks... "Hold anything? Has anybody hugged him?"    Everyone thinks... long, silent, and hard, and then all bolt up from their chairs    and head for the door. Andrew asks where they're going. Xander says they're    going to the desert, to Giles. Andrew gets excited and wants to get some tapes    for the car, but Xander says he's not coming. Andrew asks if it's because he's    evil, but Xander says no, it's because he's annoying. After some pleading from    Andrew (and a small threat that if he's left alone, he'll do something evil    like buringing something or glueing things together), Anya and Dawn convince    Xander to let him come along. All head out the front door as Anya turns to Xander    with concern. Xander agrees, saying they're out there, all alone (the SIT's    that is).

At the party, Giles feels out of place, especially when Buffy introduces Riley as her boyfriend, and he starts asking Giles about what he does now that he's out of a job since the school burned down. Buffy gushes about Professor Walsh and how she's "the smartest person she's ever met" and that she wasn't invited to the party because "she's got better things to do than hang out with a bunch of kids."

With the Armageddon-out-of-town mission a bust, the gang (minus Oz and Cordelia) congregates back at the library to research a way to find Dru and stop the Judge. Knowing she hasn't been sleeping well lately, the others let Buffy rest in Giles' office, where she slips into a dream of a huge, dim interior containing candles, greenery and, oddly, Jenny Calendar. Wearing a long white satin nightgown, the dreaming Slayer bends to examine a collection of variously-shaped boxes that seem to contain other pieces of the Judge. At that moment, Drusilla calls to her from the catwalk above, where she holds a strangely quiescent Angel hostage. When Dru presses a huge, curved dagger to Angel's throat, Buffy yells and wakes. She is only slightly comforted to find Angel sitting right beside her, safe and undead - so far. Back at the lair, Dru's party gets underway and Spike presents her with the final piece to the puzzle, the Judge's head.

Dawn stays behind, trying to sound cool by saying she's command central and everyone should check in, but she knows she just has to do her homework. As they leave, Dawn then calls Spike and questions whether he sleeps. Alone with her, Spike says yes. Dawn says she knows that she can't take Spike in a fight, even with the chip in his head, but if he touches Buffy, he'll wake up on fire. Her look is dead serious and very cold.

Buffy tells Willow she doesn't have to make that kind of sacrifice, but Willow insists that it isn't; she realized when she was being held captive that she wanted to continue fighting against evil and if she's going to continue learning Wicca, there's no better place to be than the Hellmouth.

Sunnydale High School has Buffy walking into "Principal    Robin M. Wood"'s office and closing the door behind her. She looks through    files, tries to be a little sneaky and search a little, and wonders "Now    if I were a sign of being evil, where would I be?" She glances at a VERY    large wooden wall cabinet and approaches it, but just as she's about to open    it, Principal Wood catches her, standing in the doorway! Wood asks what she's    doing. She nervously tries to pass it off as her looking for supplies and tries    to rush out, but he stops her and and calmly asks her what she's doing that    night. Buffy says eagerly she's preparing for tomorrow's councelling sessions,    then admits "watching a reality show about a millionare?" And then    Wood asks her out to dinner! Buffy smiles and is a bit uneasily surprised, especially    when he makes a bad joke about her not being obligated because of her job. She    then smiles more and says she'd be happy to have dinner with him later that    night. As she exits his office, Principal wood suspicously closes the door behind    her and pulls a blood soaked hankerchief from his jacket pocket, then unwraps    it to reviel a knife! He wipes more blood from the blade as he walks over to    the large cabinet doors Buffy eyed before. They open to reveal... a whiteboard!    gasp But then he grabs the bottom of the whiteboard and it slowly slides up    to unveil a weapons display! 21 different types of swords, knives, and axes    hang in the case as Wood delicately replaces the 22nd, the dagger.

Buffy now knows Spike has his soul back, and asks her if it's what she wanted? He comments that everyone is in here (clutches his head), including "him", and everyone is now telling him to go to hell. Buffy questions why he would do it. His words come fourth, almost as if scripture (it might be actual bible text, I'm unsure). Buffy watches in stunned silence as he approaches a large cross at the front of the church. "Can we rest now, Buffy?" he asks as he leans and hugs the cross with his bare chest, his skin starting to smoke at it's touch. "Can we rest?"

Buffy says she's not in the mood for more jealous vampire    crap, which makes Spike get in the jab "he wears lifts ya know." Buffy    glances over at the punching bag and sees a drawing of Angel's head taped to    it, and she rolls her eyes, saying that one of those days she's just gonna put    the both of them in a room and let them wrestle it out. Spike changes the subject    and asks where the trinket is, the amulet that Angel gave Buffy. Buffy pulls    it out of her pocket as Spike says it's his. Buffy asks him how he reasons that    out. Spike heard everything, how it goes to "someone with a soul, but more    than human." That would be him and he holds out his hand for it. Buffy    says that it's volitale and dangerous. "You'll need someone strong to bear    it then" Spike answers, still holding out his hand. Thinking for a bit,    looking a little concerned, Buffy says "Angel said the Amulet was meant    to be worn by a champion." Spike's demeanor instantly goes down-hill. He    starts to look hurt, but Buffy approaches him and gently places the amulet in    his hand, looking at him with meaning.

Shortly after arriving at the party, Willow walks up to Riley and gives him some last-minute pointers on dealing with Buffy. Unfortunately, Riley chokes at the key moment and ends up making a fool of himself in front of Buffy. After a pep talk on the couch, Riley tries again while Willow heads back to the dorm.

While Riley attempts to save some of his dignity, the trio enter a hidden elevator and descend to an underground complex. After getting out, they pass by several demons and supernatural creatures undergoing tests, scientists in white coats, and transports loaded with armed commandos. They finally meet up with their boss, Maggie Walsh, who informs them that one of the subjects, Spike, has escaped.

Xander and Cordelia's secret smooching is witnessed by Willow, who's completely crushed. Buffy finally finds Angel in his apartment, but he's distant, snotty and generally obnoxious. She is devastated. Jenny's uncle says that if Angel experiences one moment of true happiness, his soul will be taken and Angelus will return. This freaks out Jenny, who realizes that many people will die. As Willow and Xander try to make up, Angel appears at school and asks Willow to approach him. Jenny shows up with a cross and Angel grabs Willow, trying to bite her. Buffy enters and he kisses her, then shoves her and leaves. Giles says some event must have triggered this transformation, but Buffy won't say, leaving Willow to figure out that they must have made love. Buffy goes home and sobs. She dreams of her special night with Angel, then of a funeral where Jenny is in black. She busts into Jenny's class, demanding to know what she knows. Jenny admits she's a watcher sent to keep Angel from happiness, so he'd pay for what he did. Buffy tells her to restore his curse to make him human again. Xander decides that even though no forged weapon could kill The Judge, that was way before today's technology, so he sneaks in an army base (using what he learned when he became a soldier on Halloween). Buffy, Giles and Jenny discover her uncle's body-- Angel killed him. The Judge, who was weak from all those years of not killing, is finally ready to take over the world. The gang wonders where he'll find the crowds he wants, since the Bronze is closed, and Oz suggests the movies at the mall. The Judge is there, preparing to vaporize everyone. Wielding the biggest, baddest gun imaginable, Buffy shoots The Judge. He's toast -- well, at least dismembered again -- and the crowd is saved. But Angel still wants to kill Buffy. She doesn't have the heart to slay him, but gives him a wicked kick in the groin, which knocks him to the floor.

Yorkshire, 1880- Angelus throttles William at the bottom of a coal mine, asking why they haven't killed him yet. William, now having adopted his distinctive accent and swagger, notes that he goes by the name "Spike" now. Spike's strong tendency to incite mob riots simply for the joy of the fray is causing trouble for his new vampire family; his most recent hijinks resulted in their having to hide in an abandoned mineshaft which angers Angelus as he likes to treat himself and his 'women' to luxury. Angelus feels that Spike's uncouth behavior is putting them increasingly in danger from being hunted by angry mobs. Spike feels Angelus only engages in fights that he knows he will win, rather than fighting with zeal and veracity. Angelus prefers the artistry of killing, seeing it as separating them from being mere animals. Spike's insults finally cause Angelus to lash out viciously, and he very nearly stakes Spike before Spike notes that he has proved his point. The elder vampire notes that if he cannot teach Spike the error of his ways, someday an angry mob would; that or the Slayer. Spike sits up, suddenly interested, and asks: "What's a Slayer?"

Buffy then heads to Spike's. Buffy attempts to sexually assault Spike, before he realizes who she is. "I told you to stop trying to see me," she finally jokes and then she and Spike go underground for sex. In the meantime, Xander confronts Willow, but she knows nothing about the invisibility and is offended that she is automatically being blamed. She leaves in a huff to try to figure out what happened to Buffy. Xander ends up meeting up with Willow at the site of Buffy becoming invisible. Willow keeps being tempted by magic, but uses her brains and deduction instead of magic, and figures out that the perpetrators are the drivers of the black van they've been seeing around Buffy. She gives Xander a traffic cone that was also made invisible, and he takes it back to the Magic Box. Xander and Anya do research, and discover that the Invisibility Ray is causing the structure of the traffic cone to break down. Anya is too self-involved to realize the implications, but Xander realizes that the same thing will happen to Buffy if the invisibility isn't reversed. Meanwhile, Warren is trying to fix the invisibility ray but says that Buffy will die from the overload of radiation she is getting while she continues to be invisible. He finds no problem with that, but Andrew and Jonathan are upset and do not want to kill her, and so Warren grudgingly agrees to fix her. Xander then runs to Spike's crypt in search of Buffy, where he finds Spike in bed. He's actually having sex with Buffy, but to Xander's eyes, Spike looks naked and alone, and Spike explains that he's "doing push-ups". Xander has a chat with Spike, wanting to know where Buffy is, and Spike honestly says that he hasn't "seen" her. Throughout the conversation, invisible Buffy gropes and physically teases Spike. Spike tries to act normal, somewhat unsuccessfully. Xander finally leaves, disgusted by Spike's odd behavior, telling Spike that he really needs to get a girlfriend.

On her way home from work, Buffy runs into Lily again. Lily gets Buffy's attention by calling her by her real name, then reminds Buffy that she once went by the name of Chantarelle and was involved in a vampire-worshipping cult. Buffy explains that Anne is really her middle name. During their conversation, an old man rudely bumps the both of them aside as he walks towards the street. When asked if he's okay, the old man turns to them and says, "I'm no one." With that, he walks into the middle of the street, then stops in the path of an oncoming car. Buffy dashes into the street and pushes him aside just in time, but not before the car collides and sends her slamming into the pavement. A few locals offer to help her and call an ambulance, but Buffy quickly leaves the scene without even a limp. On the way, Buffy meets a relatively clean-cut man. His name is Ken, and he's handing out flyers for a shelter called the Family Home. Meanwhile, in the Bronze, Xander chats with Willow and Oz about their failure at vampire slaying. Seeing Cordelia enter the Bronze with a few of her friends, Xander hatches a plan to use her as bait.

The series premiere begins at Sunnydale High School, where a boy  breaks into the school during the night with a seemingly reluctant girl , promising her mischief and therefore fun. Nervous and on edge, the girl says she thinks she heard something and fears someone is in the school, other than the two of them. The boy calls out but gets no response, leading him to say "it's nothing" to the girl and assure her that they "are alone". The girl says "okay, that's good", after which she turns to face the boy, revealing her facial morph into her true identity: a vampire. She then bites the boy's neck.

Although Xander and Dawn both think Warren deserves punishment, Buffy           doesn't want it to come from Willow, since "the human world has its own rules for           dealing with people like him." Despite Xander's worries, Buffy wants Dawn to stay with           Spike; Buffy knows he wouldnt harm Dawn. But when they arrive at the lair, Clem tells           them Spike took off for parts unknown. Dawn stays with Clem, even though she wants           to help Buffy.

In the minutes after Willow's flaying of Warren, Buffy, Xander and Anya run through the woods. As Xander fights the urge to be sick after what he saw, Buffy deduces by Willow's last words ("one down") mean that she's going after Jonathan and Andrew, who are still in jail. Confused, Xander asks why Willow would now try to kill Jonathan and Andrew since they had nothing to do with killing Tara, but Buffy says that Willow has an addictive personality and once she starts something, she won't stop. Anya then brings up the fact that Willow will take some time to get to the jail, even at her magic level. Using her new demon powers, Anya teleports herself to get there first so she can save the boys. Buffy and Xander then talk about Willow with Buffy saying that now that Willow has killed someone, things change. Xander, however, tries to justify Willow's actions by again reminding Buffy that Warren was a cold-blooded serial killer of women just getting started, and that he finally got what he deserved. Despite this, Buffy still doesn't believe that Warren deserved to die for killing Tara, but she and Xander agree that Jonathan and Andrew definitely don't deserve to die since they never killed anybody. Seconds later, Buffy and Xander find Xander's car destroyed, courtesy of Willow, and Buffy runs ahead by herself, leaving a self-loathing Xander behind to complain.

Dawn tries to get away downstairs, but she's followed and Anya goes off on her for stealing. Buffy, realizing the jacket she was given for her birthday was also stolen, has a hard time accepting her sister's behavior and tries to blame the guidance counselor that Dawn talked to for the situation. Anya puts the pieces together, concludes that the one responsible for their mess is Halfrek (a fellow Vengeance demon and friend of Anya's) and summons her because she is the only one who can lift the spell. Halfrek appears in response to Anya's summons, but is stabbed by the demon and falls to the ground.

Jonathan remains hostile at first, claiming that he is tired of everybody disregarding him for his small size and his lack of abilities. Buffy civilly talks to him, telling him that the reason everybody ignores him is that they have their own problems to deal with. She lets him hand the rifle over to her and then unloads it, but is then surprised to learn he hadn't planned to murder anyone: he had actually gone to the tower to kill himself.

Buffy faces a powerful new breed of vampire.

That night, Post tells the Slayers and Giles that she was sent down to take over as Faith's Watcher and report back on the entire situation in Sunnydale. Faith initially balks at the idea, however Giles tells her they should cooperate if the Watchers Council feels she needs observation. Mrs. Post then states she is also supposed to report on Giles,as there is worry he has become 'too American'. She takes the time to not-so-subtly insult him at every turn. She tells them about a demon, Lagos, that has come in search of the Glove of Myhnegon and that she wants both Slayers at full strength to kill it. Buffy then goes to the mansion with Angel where they're practicing Tai Chi. One thing leads to another and they end up very close to a kiss. Buffy mentions Lagos, then leaves, knowing she can't let them get so close again.

Later that night, Buffy watches Angel as he sleeps on the floor of the

Anya says as she rushes to clean up the small burn. Willow looks at the map and says that one of the spots looks promising, a small group of caves in a rock cliff nearby. Anya says it sounds pretty thin, which is when Willow suggests she teleport over there real quick to check it out. It is then that Anya has to admit she can't teleport there, she can only teleport for official business. It's a privilege, not a right. It got taken away when she had to pull the Vengeance curse the previous week. Willow offers her sympathy to Anya, who says the Vengeance just isn't what it used to be. Willow says she thought Anya enjoyed... "inflicting." Anya says it sounds cool, but now it's quite upsetting. Vengeance isn't the same anymore, not as fulfilling. Willow compares her old situation with Anya's, wondering if she feels like her power isn't really all what she thought, and that it can be more trouble than it's worth? Anya says it's very over dramatically stated, but she's right. Anya apologizes to Willow for her sadness, and Willow does the same to Anya. They understand each other's feelings. "It did get a little sexy, didn't it?" says Anya, to which Willow momentarily smirks at, but then the witch shakes it off and heads for the door, saying she has to find the demon that killed the boy. Anya lightly tries to keep Willow there, asking if there's another spell she could do to help, maybe a spell to find Buffy and Xander? Willow says she tried that, and it went bad. The spell said that Buffy and Xander didn't exist.

Buffy and Riley fight a vampire and a demon in the cemetery, finally disposing of both of them. While they intend to go tell Giles about the odd pairing of demon and vampire, they opt instead for sex at Riley's dorm at Lowell House. Riley gets up in the middle of the night, acting as if he hears something from the restroom. All he finds is a dripping faucet in the tub. Xander's driving an ice cream truck for his new job, and Anya rides along with him to complain about their diminishing relationship. Trying to convince her that there is nothing wrong with him or their relationship, Xander suggests they have sex right there in the truck.

Buffy goes to school in a daze -- she's never killed someone who wasn't already undead. Knowing Buffy wouldn't have tangled with someone just because he was dating her mom, Xander, Willow and Cordelia try to figure out what Ted was up to. Xander's extremely concerned, but suddenly says, "Don't sweat it." This is a big, honking clue to Willow, and she realizes what's caused Xander's change of attitude -- he's eating one of Ted's homebaked cookies. Analyzation shows the cookies contain a tranquilizer. Then Cordelia investigates further and finds out Ted has had four wives. Meanwhile, at the cemetery, Jenny apologizes to Giles for being short with him, but their warm fuzzy moment is interrupted by a vampire who attacks Giles. Jenny tries to shoot the demon with Giles' crossbow, but hits Giles by accident. Giles removes the bow and kills the demon. Buffy discovers the dead Ted in her room, looking remarkably healthy. She stabs him with a nail file and discovers he's a robot. Xander, Willow and Cordelia continue their sleuthing and stumble upon what's left of Ted's ex-wives in his closet. Back at the Buffy's, Ted approaches Joyce, who is freaked to see him, then glad to see him, then completely wigged when he starts short-circuiting and revealing his intent to dominate her. Buffy whacks him with a frying pan, exposing his robot face and killing him (although on this show you never know...). At school, it's just another ordinary post-slaying day at Sunnydale, until the gang discover Giles and Jenny making out.

At the school that night, the cloaked group gathers again around a circle of coins and one of the boys turns out to be Peter. He checks with the others to make sure the school is secure and that no one can get in or out. Then, he pulls a bound and blindfolded Cassie out to the circle and holds a meat cleaver to her neck. She is to be a sacrifice to a demon that will provide the boys with "infinite riches."

Dawn questions why Buffy didn't tell her about what Spike did and tells her sister that she can't protect her from the world. Anya appears in the hole and updates Buffy on the situation with Willow. On Kingman's Bluff, Willow raises the spire of a Satanic temple out of the ground to help her with her plans. Anya explains how Willow is going to end the world by using her powerful new-found magic to drain Earth's life energy though the effigy of the demon Proserpexa, and that nothing magical or supernatural (including Buffy) can stop her. She notes that Giles is short on time and leaves to return to him.

Xander barricades himself in the basement with Cordelia who is touched to learn that Xander performed the spell for her. The love-crazed mob breaks in and attacks Xander and Cordelia just as Giles and Amy manage to lift the spell.

"Can I borrow a pencil?" asks a boy next to Dawn. Dawn opens up a geeky pencil bag and hands him one. "Thanks alot" he says, but now he's rotted, zombie like. He stabs at Dawn in the face. She screams, falling to the floor, covering her eye. The class jolts, and the teacher rushes forward, but Dawn checks herself and she's ok. She apologizes, saying it was a Bee, which she's alergic to, and asks to be excused to go to the washroom. "Guess it runs in the family" a boy remarks.

The next morning, Buffy passes by room 118 and sees the body, while Giles reads several articles in the newspaper about identical murders. In each case, the heart was removed from the victim's chest. When Olivia finishes her sketch of the creature she saw the previous night, Giles recognizes it and pulls out a book of fairy tales. Assembled in an empty lecture hall, the gang watches as Giles presents a slide show of transparencies that explain their situation. According to Giles, the Gentlemen need seven hearts. In order to keep the victims from screaming, they have stolen everybody's voices. Now, the only thing that can kill them is an actual human voice  not a recording, as Willow suggests.

Willow and Xander show up at the library, where they hear that Buffy has gone off to see the Master. Xander goes to Angel's apartment where he forces Angel to lead him to the Master's lair.

Back in the Summer's home, all the SIT's along with Buffy, Xander, Dawn, and Willow sit at the dining room table, freaked out by the First's appearance as Eve amongst them. The SIT's are filled with doubt, wondering how they'll be able to fight the First. Buffy tries to counter, saying that they've got to stick together and that now is not the time to fall apart, they're stronger than that. They just have to wait for Giles and Anya for information and stick together. Andrew interrupts from the corner "She's right! Where would the Justice League be if they hadn't put aside their differences to stop the Imperium and his shapeshifting alien horde?" "Dont' help me" says Buffy, stairing daggers into Andrew. Xander mentions that the Ubervamp is on his way there so they need a plan. Buffy says she thinks the Ubervamp doesn't need an invite into the house and turns to Willow, asking her if she thinks she could use magic. Willow sighs, realizing they need a barrier. The scene starts to break down as we hear the different SIT's start to question everything, how to fight, what if the barrier doesn't hold, how to kill the Ubervamp when Buffy staked it. Buffy watches and looks at Willow, who looks concerned. Both get up and slowly exit the worry-filled room, passing by Xander who is startled by something and blurts out "What?" He exits after them and all three scoobies stand silently in the kitchen as the SIT's jabber in the background.

Xander jokes with Willow about his injury and the "pirate" resemblance, but Willow starts to cry. While Andrew draws pictures on a large sketch pad, Anya lectures the Potential Slayers about killing Turok-Han and how difficult that will be for them, but the girls have their minds focused on the danger posed by Caleb. Kennedy and Amanda sneak up to the kitchen and talk with Faith about the lack of progress they're making with Caleb. Buffy returns home with the police reports and divides it amongst Faith, Dawn, and the other girls for research. Dawn prods Buffy for information about Xander's condition, but Buffy has a hard time thinking about it, let alone talking about it. Kennedy mentions how Caleb was able to easily overpower Buffy, unintentionally making Buffy feel very guilty. Buffy takes the reminder badly and heads out to the school to pick up the rest of her belongings, sending the Potentials downstairs to be with the others and instructing Faith to lead the research effort.

At swim practice the next day, Buffy tells Willow and Cordy about Angel's distaste for Gage's blood. She believes that Gage may have been taking steroids, which might have turned Angel off. Willow then considers the possibility that the steroids might be what's attracting the creature. They then find out that Xander has joined the swim team. The position was open due to the recent deaths, so Xander took it as an opportunity to spy on Gage when Buffy couldn't. After spending some time in the steam room, Xander gets dressed and meets Buffy outside of the locker room, telling her that Gage is still inside. She soon hears Gage screaming and runs inside, where she sees the creature standing in front of Gage. She gets between the two of them, but something's wrong with Gage. To her horror, Buffy watches as Gage tears away his own skin in agony before emerging as the same type of creature standing behind her. Gage's former skin drops to the floor, and he quickly attacks Buffy. The two of them are too much for Buffy, and when her guard drops, one of them bite into her arm. Coach Marin arrives to pull Buffy out of danger, and the two creatures escape through a hole in the floor. Buffy and Giles question Coach Marin, but he denies any knowledge of substance abuse in his team. They can't figure out what's going on, so Buffy assigns Xander to learn more about the team's drug use while she and Willow talk to Nurse Greenliegh. However, Nurse Greenliegh is already being led to her doom by Coach Marin, who won't listen to her pleas to stop the experiments. He drops her into the sewer below, where the fish creatures quickly feed on her.

Episode Summary by: Alan Hufana
|
The tortured ghost of a former Sunnydale High student reenacts a murder-suicide on the night of the school's Sadie Hawkins dance. Taken over to play the parts, Buffy and Angelus change the tragic outcome just enough for the lovers' spirits to find peace, and for Buffy to learn about forgiveness.
|
Buffy and Willow are on a stakeout at the cemetery while discussing which classes Buffy should take for her first semester at college. They discuss the fact that Buffy is choosing her courses at the last second, which she credits to a busy summer of slaying and that Giles has told her to start keeping her identity as the Slayer under wraps again. The vampire they're waiting awakens and prepares to attack them, and they don't even notice when he quietly slips away when he sees their arsenal of vampire-slaying gear.

Buffy and Riley's passionate lovemaking energizes supernatural elements inside a frat house.
|
As they leave with the supplies, Buffy, Angel and Spike are surrounded by a group of Trick's vampires, led by one of Spike's former lackeys, Lenny. Spike points out that if Buffy and Angel leave him to die, then Willow and Xander die too. Buffy reluctantly joins the brawl. After killing a few, they retreat back into the shop and barricade themselves in, fighting the vampires who get inside. Lenny makes the mistake of insulting Spike, who, incensed, brutally beats and stakes him. Eventually, Angel and Buffy use bottled holy water to scare off all the remaining vampires. Spike, inspired and refreshed by the thrill of the fight, realizes that the only way he is going to get Dru back is if he becomes the man he once was, the man she loved. He tells Angel and Buffy that their friends are at the factory, and that he is going to "find Dru, tie her up, and torture her until she likes me again." As he leaves the shop, he sticks his head back in to note to the bemused pair that "Love's a funny thing."

Later, Andrew talks to the video camera and uses his big white board to illustrate and explain the array of evil forces in Sunnydale. He interviews various members of the household, blithely re-imagining current and past incidents in an idealized and incorrect way.

After researching the resurrection spell, Tara reports to Buffy that the spell didn't bring Buffy back "wrong". Tara explains that the only effect the process of re-materializing had on Buffy's body and soul was something akin to a molecular suntan. This effect didn't make Buffy more or less human; she's as human as she ever was, but it was just enough of a change to "fool" Spike's chip into wrongly categorizing her as non-human. Buffy is shocked, and asks Tara to check again. Tara assures Buffy she's certain but can tell from the reaction that something's wrong. Buffy then confesses to Tara that more than just an exchange of punches has been going on between her and Spike. Tara is supportive, first asking Buffy if she loves Spike because if she does, it's okay, since Spike did a lot of good the previous summer, and Tara (unlike the other Scoobies) believes he truly loves Buffy. Buffy does not reply, looking noticeably guilty. Then Tara tells Buffy that if it isn't love that Buffy feels, that's okay too. Buffy admitted that she had been using Spike and nothing is okay about that, calling herself "wrong". Caught between the unsavoriness of using Spike, Buffy begins to desperately plead for something to be "wrong" with her so that she can blame her "wrongness" for what she does with Spike, how she treats him and how she lets him treat her. She breaks down crying in Tara's lap, unable to accept that she's actively deciding to use Spike.
|
Upstairs, Buffy feeds Spike some of the animal blood as Anya and Xander meet in the bathroom to rave about their 'good cop, bad cop' performance with Andrew. Buffy joins them and although none of them have information yet, they're sure they'll get some soon. Back in the bedroom, Spike is calmed and talks to Buffy about how little he remembers about his killing. She asks about how he got his soul and he tells her about the demon trials.

Buffy and Caleb's fight begins anew, but Buffy is able to best him again and this time kills him for real by slicing him in two from the crotch up using the Scythe. Angel recovers ready to take on Caleb himself, but finds two fresh halves waiting for him. Angel therefore gives her the information he obtained as well an amulet intended to be worn by someone ensouled, yet more than human. He tells her he will fight alongside her, but she turns him down, and he asks for a reason why. She tells him that if she fails to stop the First, she's going to need a second front and needs and his team to organize it. Angel suggests that she actually wants him to leave because of Spike. The two discuss Spike's soul, and Buffy's feelings for him. He shows obvious jealousy and annoyance about the fact that Buffy has feelings for Spike (as well as the fact Spike has a soul, claiming that he was doing it before it was cool). Buffy in turn, annoyed by his childish and possessive attitude he has towards her, questions his maturity, asking "Are you twelve?". Buffy refuses to confirm if she is in love with Spike and denies he is her boyfriend, but confesses that she does have deep feelings for him. When Angel warns her that the relationship would never work, Buffy brings up their own tortured romance. When Angel asks about the future, and if he has a place in it (which is basically asking if there's a chance they could ever get back together) Buffy explains, using a cookie-baking analogy, that she still doesn't know who she is or the person she's going to become and needs more time to find out. Angel agrees to leave and turns over the amulet to her, telling her he'll organize the second front and asks her to make sure he doesn't need it. As he walks into the shadows, echoing his very first appearance, Buffy tells him there might be a future for them, but it will be a long time coming, if ever. He walks off after saying "I ain't getting any older."

In the hall RJ catches up with Dawn, saying he heard that Wood called her into his office. He says it sucks with the whole inquisition thing. "Yeah, no one expects the Spanish inquistion... god, it's like I have a disease or something." (a monty python reference from Dawn, but the second part of that line lost me). Dawn says they just talked about the accident and RJ says with a wink that it sucks when things like this happen out of nowhere. "Yeah... out of nowhere." Dawn says with understanding back. RJ asks Dawn if they wanna meet up after practice. With a big smile, Dawn says "yes!"

Buffy joins Willow, Oz, and Xander, remarking that Xander is the odd man out since he is not a college student. The group discuss the encounter with Parker (which Buffy says was just "random adorableness"), and the previous night's demon attack. Buffy is annoyed when Kathy - wearing Buffy's sweater - invites herself to their table. Kathy remarks that since Buffy ruined her sweater, she didn't think that she would mind.

At school, Giles has been trying to decipher the markings on the fragments of the Inca seal, and he asks Ampata to decipher it. She reluctantly explains that it describes how a 16 year old girl was chosen to die to save her people, and a bodyguard has also been chosen to keep her from straying from the path. She also tells Giles to destroy the seal completely, with an implication that if it is reassembled, it will be a danger to Ampata. The bodyguard, meanwhile, has gone to the school. He finds Ampata and confronts her. She evades him, but he finally catches up with her later on. She tells him that she wants to live, that she shouldn't have been forced to give up her life at such a young age, that she was innocent. He tells her it was her duty, and that she has killed other innocent people now. She then grabs him and gives him the kiss of death in the school bathroom, sucking out his life to keep herself alive, young, and beautiful.

Back to the battle, and unfortunately Buffy is losing. After some punches and kicks, she is slammed into the scaffold, which causes Kennedy to lose her crossbow, which falls in front of Buffy. Buffy grabs it, takes aim, and fires into the approaching Ubervamp, who still continues forward, ignoring the bolt that sticks out of his chest. Rising up, Buffy grabs a pipe and starts to whack away at Ubie (and she does this neat poll vault thing with it too, using the pipe to get an axe that lays nearby), but of course, Ubie gets the advantage again and dodges the axe swings, grabs Buffy, and throws her into a construction trailer's side. More punches, more dodges, Buffy is badly losing, laying on the ground and being kicked. Ubie then grabs her and throws her UP through some scaffolding boards, where she lands on the scaffold a level up. Ubie is there, approaching to attack yet again. Dazed, Buffy doesnt' have time to struggle as Ubie grips her around the throat and raises her in that classic stance. The SIT's want to help, saying they have to do something, but Willow tells them to wait and watch. Buffy struggles in Ubie's grasp, but then gets an idea. She grabs the crossbow bolt from Ubie's chest and breaks the end off, then Jams it in his right eye! He screams in pain and she is dropped. Then it's fists and feel of fury as Buffy is supremely pissed and starts to beat the crap out of Ubie, slowly beating him down into a dazed state. He then is punched and spins around, which gives Buffy enough time to grab a thick wire that was nearby and wrap it around ubie's throat. She starts choaking the vampire with all her strength until, like a blade, the wire cuts his head clean off and sure enough, PAF, Ubie turns to dust!

The SIT's all line up along the cliff's    edge, each having some sort of weapon, also staring down in horror. "I'm    not worried..." Buffy says, almost panicing. "Really? Cause I'm flashing    back to Xander's whole bathroom speech." Amanda asks Buffy for reassurance.    Buffy suddenly gets a little brave and shows strength. "I'm not worried.    As long as Willow can work her spell before they..." Suddenly the cavern    goes quiet as the ubervamps notice their attackers "... see us." The    ubervamps on the cavern below instantly start to charge, with hundreds of bodies    flying foward. Buffy looks on in disbelief.

Dawn tells her that while both are monsters, at least Glory is upfront about it. Glory boasts that she could have killed Buffy at any time, but didn't because of Ben's residual humanity.

Glory doesn't take kindly to thisand tells Dawn that her big sister won't be turning up, and even if she does she might not be there to save her, but to kill her.

Xander gets into an argument with Giles over Jenny's last wish before telling Buffy that she's willing to forget all about the murders in order to get her beloved Angel back. Elsewhere, Angel tells Spike the story of a demon named Acathla. This demon possesses the power to literally swallow the Earth into Hell, but he was stopped by a knight centuries ago. His body turned to stone with the sword still embedded in it, then was concealed in the stone tomb and buried deep beneath the ground. With that, two vampires open the tomb, revealing the body of Acathla inside. Only someone worthy can remove the sword from Acathla's body, freeing him to reign terror on the world. Later that night, Buffy finds the claddagh ring that Angel gave to her before he lost his soul. She goes outside for a walk and encounters Kendra, who has returned to take care of another dark force in Sunnydale. At the library, Kendra shows them a valuable weapon that she brought with her. It is a sword that was blessed by the same knight who stopped Acathla. If Angel succeeds in reviving the demon, it may be their only chance to stop it. Buffy asks Willow to perform the curse as soon as possible, but they need an Orb of Thesulah first. Luckily, Giles already has one in his office.

The one in which dreams can come true
|
At the hospital, doctors work on Buffy until a black-haired Willow bursts in. Effortlessly,           she lifts the bullet from Buffy's body and heals her. Willow can sense Warren's           essence, and with Xander and Buffy in tow, locates him riding a bus headed for the           border. She draws Warren off the bus and throttles him, only to discover he's a Bot. She           finally confesses to her friends that Tara's dead, and Warren did it. Disappointed but           determined to find the real villain, Willow heads off down the lonely road, using a spell           to prevent her two best friends from following her.

Old and new friends gather at the Summers home for Buffy's twenty-first birthday party and it goes splendidly - at first. Feeling neglected by Buffy and the Scoobies, Dawn's wish to keep people from leaving her is answered by Anya's demon friend Halfrek, who binds the attendees of the party to the house. When Tara tries a spell to free them, she only makes the situation worse by accidentally releasing a demon trapped inside a sword.
|
Willow tries to get as many vampires as possible to go outside the Bronze, where they can pick them off one by one. She also surreptitiously signals to Oz that she's herself and not a vampire. Unpersuaded by Willow's unconvincing act at the Bronze, Anya points out to the Vampire Willow's vampire minions that their leader is a fake. Willow screams, signaling Buffy, Angel, and Giles to enter. As they fight the vampires, Willow retreats to the stage with Oz. Vampire Willow then returns, throws Oz out of the way and starts choking Willow. Buffy breaks it up, but Willow shouts for her not to stake Vampire Willow. Despite fully knowing what her evil doppelganger is capable of, Willow cannot bear to have her staked. She convinces the others to send her back, arguing that Vampire Willow should have the chance to survive in her own world, a suggestion which the doppelganger accepts. With Anya's help, Vampire Willow is returned to her world; she is transported back to the middle of the brawl in the factory. She has just enough time to smile at being returned to her reality before Oz grabs her and shoves her against a protruding piece of wood from the humans' cage, just like before. Vampire Willow has just enough time to snarl "Oh fu-" before she turns to dust.
|
After heading out, Buffy tries to convince Faith to come clean and confess their crime to Giles. Faith reminds Buffy that they were both involved, so if she goes down, she's taking Buffy with her. Buffy then spots Willow and tries to talk to her. However, Willow is still stung by Buffy's recent behavior in which she has been hanging out with Faith more and spending less time with Willow. Meanwhile, Mayor Wilkins shreds all of Finch's files that contain anything related to their dirty work. Mr. Trick listens as Mayor Wilkins wonders if Allan Finch was conspiring against him somehow and ends up feeling miserable that now he'll never know and won't have the chance to 'scold' him. Mr. Trick cheers the mayor up by telling him that Finch's autopsy report showed that there were wooden splinters in his stab wound. This, combined with the fact the scene of the murder was also the location for vampire activity, makes Mayor Wilkins realize that Buffy or Faith were responsible and cheers up at the thought that at least one of them may be sent down for murder.

After a night shift of cleaning the grill at Doublemeat Palace, the Slayer is challenged by a Skanky Vamp.              Whew! This Living Dead Guy is all grossed out by Buffy's greasy smell. She dusts him easily. Then sniffing              herself, she's got to agree with the Skank's odor assessment.

Giles' dream begins with him trying to hypnotize Buffy, who merely laughs at his old-fashioned ways.  Suddenly, Giles finds himself walking through a macabre nighttime Fair in the cemetery with Buffy and Olivia, who pushes a baby stroller.  A pigtailed Buffy runs ahead, begging to play the midway games.  She finds a game where she throws a ball at a wooden vampire figure, and misses.  After Giles coaches her she hits the vampire and jumps up and down.  Spike calls over from his crypt, urging Giles to come over before he misses everything, and Giles obliges.  When he enters the crypt, Olivia sits in the corner, crying over an overturned baby stroller, and Spike poses for bunch of Paparazzi.  As Giles tries to figure out what to do with all of this, he runs into the Cheese man, who is wearing slices of cheese on his shoulders and forehead.  Appalled, he walks out of the crypt and into The Bronze, where Xander and Willow study Giles' books on the old library furniture.  Giles comes in carrying another book, apologizing for his tardiness.  Despite boasting a gaping chest wound, Xander seems to be more annoyed by having to attend Anya's comedy act, which he professes as his real reason for being there.  As Anya tells jokes on the stage, Willow and Xander tell Giles that something is following them.  He suggests that their old selves are following them.  Suddenly Giles jumps onto the stage, and bursts into song, singing about how the spell they performed with Buffy must have released some primal evil. As the crowd gets into the music, he sings for Willow to look into the Chronicles for a reference to a warrior beast.  A burst of feedback brings the song to a halt, and Giles traces the microphone cord backstage to find the source of the problem.  He crawls back on his hands and knees until he finds a watch in the wires, then freezes as he realizes the creature is right above him.  He tells the creature that he knows who it is, and that he can defeat the creature with only his intellect.  As he tells the creature that it underestimates his powers because it never had a Watcher, the creature scalps him, and the 'real' Giles convulses in his sleep in Buffy's living room.

After a biology class, Dr. Gregory is killed by an unseen monster, which only shows a pair of large eyes and an insectile limb. The next day, Buffy is alarmed by news of Dr. Gregory's disappearance, but the boys in her class are more interested in the beautiful substitute teacher, Natalie French , who seems to have a fixation on insects, especially the praying mantis. Miss French suggests making model egg sacs for the upcoming science fair and asks the class for help. She selects Blayne as her lab partner for that day, to be followed by Xander the next day.

Buffy sits next to Holden, talking about Spike, about how he does care for her in his own sick, weird way. She then says she wanted to be loved, but also to be punished because of all this power she had. She feels that she's worse than everyone else, that she's not worthy of their love because... even though they do love her their opinions don't matter. They haven't been though what she has, she's the Slayer. She feels like she's better than them, superior. Holden listens to her speech and then breaks it down, saying "You do have a superiority complex with an inferiority complex about it." Buffy says it doesn't make sense, but Holden says it makes every sort of sense. She feels alone, and everybody feels alone until they die. The understanding Holden then gets up and shadowboxes for a second, wondering if Buffy's ready for the big battle? Buffy rises and says yes, then thanks him for listening to her and understanding. He nods as he puts up his dukes. Buffy says "Listen, that stuff with Spike..." and Holden halts her for a moment. "Did you say Spike?"

During the mission briefing, Maggie and Dr. Angleman explain the squad's objective.  They must capture a Polgara demon, which defends itself with bone skewers that extend from its arms.  Dr. Angleman makes it perfectly clear that they must leave the demon's arms unharmed, which prompts a series of curious questions from Buffy.  Afterwards, Riley assigns Forrest and Graham to head the Beta team, while Buffy accompanies him on the Alpha team.  Out on patrol, Graham spots Spike walking through the woods. Failing to capture him with a net, Graham fires a tracking device into Spike's back as he makes his getaway.  Distracted by Forrest's call on the radio, the Polgara demon takes Riley by surprise.  Buffy rushes in to attack, while Riley and another agent ready their tasers.  A drop kick to the demon's chest by Buffy gives them the opening they need, and soon the Polgara demon is stunned into submission.  Stimulated by the fight, Buffy and Riley spend the night together in bed, consummating their relationship under the watchful eye of a hidden surveillance camera in the ceiling of Riley's room.  Unbeknownst to either Buffy or Riley, Maggie Walsh sits in a secret room, watching their lovemaking on a monitor.

At the Magic Box, Buffy trains for the upcoming battle as everyone else works on ideas. Knowing they can't set off for Glory's location too soon (as, if they get defeated quickly, there will be no way to stop the ritual), it's just a case of waiting for the right time. Giles apologizes for suggesting that Dawn be killed but explains that he promised to protect the world, and sometimes has to say... or do what others feel they can't. Buffy understands, but warns him she'll stop him if he tries to hurt Dawn. The two reflect on the amount of times they've saved the world. While the apocalypse has been averted on several occasions, it feels like they've done it a hundred times. Buffy remembers how, despite her love for him, she sacrificed Angel to save the world and although it broke her heart to do so she knew it was right. However, now she feels she is being asked to sacrifice too muchand doesn't understand how she is meant to live in a world that demands so much from her before telling Giles, with tears in her eyes "I just wish my mom was here". She then tells him how the First Slayer told her that 'death is your gift' and believes that all a slayer can ever be is a killer. Giles tells Buffy that he thinks she's wrong about that. Buffy tells Giles that, regardless of what the First Slayer meant, if Dawn dies then she's finished as the Slayer.

While on patrol, Buffy and Riley tag-team a vampire in the cemetery.  Suddenly a blue, horned demon joins the vampire to form a tag-team of its own.  While Riley serves the vampire a stake, Buffy makes fast work of the howling demon.  Afterwards, Buffy and Riley are too turned on from fighting to report back to Giles.  They choose instead to head over to Riley's for some "tension relief".  Later that night, Riley wanders through the Initiative house, driven by an unknown obsession.  When he arrives in the bathroom and turns off the dripping shower, he can finally go back to bed.  The next afternoon, an ice cream truck pulls up to a curb in a quiet neighborhood.  Behind the wheel is Xander, with Anya riding shotgun to keep her boyfriend company on his new job.  Anya begins questioning his virility because Xander wasn't in the mood for sex the night before.  The defensive Xander tells her that he'll have sex with her right then and there in the back of the van.  When he starts unbuttoning his shirt, the only thing that stops Xander's kink is the fact that ten children and a parent waiting for ice cream are staring at him.  Meanwhile, Buffy, Riley, Willow, Tara and Giles meet in a study room.  They discuss the bizarre pairing of demon and vampire in the previous night's battle.  Giles explains the rarity of an alliance between these opposing members of the undead.  Before their discussion can get too theoretical, Buffy and Riley's hormones force them to leave for a pre-class quickie. Again that night, back in Riley's room, the horny couple copulates while other members of the Initiative stoke a fire in the living room downstairs.  As Buffy and Riley's passion reaches a crescendo, a fireball erupts out of the fireplace and engulfs one of the unwitting soldiers.  Forrest is barely able to smother the flames with a wall banner before his friend is seriously burned.

Harmony begins to try on the jewels while prattling on, enraging Spike who stakes her - however she is impervious to harm. Realising that she is wearing the Gem, Spike forces it off her and leaves the crypt. Meanwhile, while searching for information at Giles' house, Xander turns on the news, which is reporting on a giant sinkhole caused by the erosion of dirt beneath it.

When she measured them again in the morning, they had grown - "That's a demon thing." Willow convinces Buffy to ask Giles about Kathy being a demon, and then calls Giles to warn him about the strange behavior.

Buffy releases her aggressions on a punching bag in the training room until Riley shows up determined to talk to her. He tells her he started his late-night vamp activities because he wanted to know what Buffy felt when she was bitten by Dracula.

After Buffy tries to convince him that she's given him everything she has, Riley says that he doesn't believe her, and tells her about the offer to return to the government. He is going to leave unless she can give him a reason to stay.

Giles takes the couch at the Summers' home and talks with Buffy, telling her he'll help her take care of the financial problems in the morning.

Spike asks what to do if they run into Ben, only for everyone to get confused and tell Spike that Buffy doesn't need a doctor at the moment. Spike tries to remind them that Ben is Glory, and transformed into her right in front of them. However, no-one is able to recall this and seem unable to grasp the idea.

The knocking at his door begins again, this time a little more fierce.  As he turns around, the same man from Willows dream holds up a plate full of cheese slices, telling him that they will not protect him.  As the door breaks down, Xander runs from his bedroom into the halls of UC Sunnydale.  The halls are washed in green light, and no one notices Xander, or the creature chasing him through the halls.  He runs into Giles, and Anya, who start speaking to him in French.  He is picked up by a group of students, and suddenly he ends up inside the "Apocalypse Now" movie, walking through the forest in military camouflage.  He ends up in a dark POW camp kneeling next to another one of the prisoners, Principal Snyder.  Snyder tells Xander that he is a whipping boy, raised by mongrels to be a sacrificial lamb.  Xander stands up to relieve a cramp and finds himself in Giles' courtyard, the creature from Willow's dream hot on his tail.  He runs through Giles' house, into the halls of UC Sunnydale, through the door of Buffy's dorm room and a dark hallway, ending up back in his basement.  The knocking at the door has become very fierce, and Xander whispers that that is not the way out.  The door flies open and Xander's father walks down the stairs, scolding him for being ashamed of his family.

He walks into the library where Buffy is still listening to Giles read his books. Buffy consoles Xander, then suggests that they spend some time together that night.

Anya notices some cigarette butts in an urn, and Buffy realizes that Spike was there when Dawn found out she was the Key. Buffy then storms into his crypt and begins to beat him up. She is furious with him in letting Dawn find out she was the Key through a way she didn't want her to find out. However, Spike turns the tables on her and blames her for not telling Dawn the truth in the first place. He also notes that Dawn was going with or without him and that he only went along to protect her from harm, thinking that she would be safer with "Big Bad" looking over her shoulder. Now she's only going after him to make herself feel better. Sensing the truth in Spike's words, Buffy leaves. After she departs, Spike closes his eyes down in resignation; he clearly does not finding any relish in driving a deep wedge between the Summers sisters the way he inadvertently did when he accompanied Dawn last night.

Night-time in one of Sunnydale's many graveyards has two    SIT's, Rona and Vi (the gal who wears the colorfull beret), lurking about, on    the prowl for something. Rona stalks with a stake at the ready, Vi nervously    clutches one in both hands. Suddenly out of nowhere Rona is struck down and    falls to the ground. Spike, in Vamp face, then snarls and grabs Vi from behind.    Vi screams as Spike dips his head to bite, then looks up and, taking off his    game face, Spike asks an unseen group "OK? These two are dead... why?"    He addresses the two other SIT's (Kennedy and... um... shoot... I'll get her    name... Molly!) with Buffy nearby. It's a training session and the two SIT's    have kinda failed, but still learned. Rona says they're dead because they're    not slayers and Spike wasnt' fighting fair. Vi, still in Spike's behind-the-back    grip, agrees that they have learned and hints at being let go from Spike's painful    grasp. Spike smirks at her "fair" statement as Buffy chimes in, telling    Rona and the others that while they don't have Slayer strength and speed, they    have potential and still have inherent gifts. Buffy then asks Rona and Vi what    their instincts told them to do. At first Rona says "block his attack"    but then after Buffy glares at her, she admits they told her to run, which Vi    agrees with. Buffy says then that's what they should have done. Buffy then goes    into the Vampire mindset and has Spike attack her, but she easily gains the    upper hand, forcing Spike onto the ground and straddling him. Spike winces in    pain at the yet to be healed broken ribs which Buffy checks out caringly, a    little tenderly. A few subliminal sparks fly. "So... we're supposed to    make out with em?"

Spike does what he can to comfort Buffy and tells her that they will find her sister before it's too late, and Buffy admits that Spike had been right about Dawn; Buffy should have been honest with her in the first place.

Willow asks Buffy what is the significance of the seemingly mundane scene of placing a book on a shelf. Buffy explains that was the exact moment when, in her heart, she gave up hope of defeating Glory. Buffy reveals to Willow that she gave up in her heart and that she thinks she is the reason Glory has Dawn and Dawn will soon die. Willow tells her that it's not over yet and she can still do something to stop it.  Buffy finally comes out of her state, crying and collapsing into Willow's arms. As they return to the magic shop, Xander tells Buffy that Ben and Glory are one and the same. After reviewing the information Spike stole from Doc, Giles reveals that a bloodletting ceremony will occur to open the portal, and once it begins there is only one way to stop it: Dawn must be killed.

The Mayor instead gives a speech about how he doesn't think that Buffy and Angel should be together because they don't have any kind of real future together, as she will age while he will stay the same as well as the constant danger of him losing his soul if he feels a moment of happiness. The trade is made, however the smooth transaction is ruined when Principal Snyder shows up with security guards before anyone can leave, expecting to find drugs in the box.

Buffy rushes in and separates them awkwardly, ordering them to stop it and get    to class just as the bell rings. The hallway starts to slowly clear as Buffy    then notices a girl standing by a locker, looking very sad. Very slowly, the    girl starts to fade away. "Uh oh..." Buffy says as she rushes up to    the dissapearing girl "Hey, shy girl... don't do this!" By now she's    completely gone, but Buffy reaches up and slaps the invisible girl. She quickly    fades back into sight, smiling and commenting "you knew I was there...    you noticed me..." Buffy tells her it will be ok, just as another girl    comes out of a washroom door, crying. "The mirror said I was fat!"    she sobs as she goes sobbing away. Buffy then notices a truly geeky looking    guy complaining to two others about how rough schoolwork is. He's going a mile    a minute and says that if things keep up, he feels like he's gonna explode!    Buffy rushes up and tells him to calm down, it will be ok, then asks one of    the other two boys if they could give him a foot rub?

|
Once at home, Buffy tells Giles that his and Wood's plan failed, and shuts the door on him, saying "I think you've taught me everything I need to know."
|
Just then Willow's phone gets a text message from Xander!    She tells the others that they worked out a system of codes for emergencies    and such. She then says she can't remember if that specific code is "I    just got lucky, don't call me for a while" or "I dated a demon who's    trying to kill me." Dawn says they should play the percentages and all    assume that Xander is in danger. Andrew says that Buffy will know what to do,    which once again has Spike offering to go and get Buffy. Willow haults him,    saying she can still call Buffy, but upon dialing, they hear Buffy's phone ring    nearby. Willow picks it up off a table and all know she can't be reached. Spike    now says he'll go and get Buffy, he can still track her scent, and he heads    out the front door with a "look" from Giles. (also, in this scene,    check out Spike's right rear shoulder. What is that on his shirt?!? Eewwww....).

FLASH! Where the pedestal was now floats a glowing mass    of blue and white. Roughly the size of a door, it looks a little like the dimensional    void which Glory created years ago. All stare in wonder as Buffy circles it,    looking on, knowing what it means. Buffy says she has to go inside, but Willow    and Wood argue, saying she doesn't know what the exchange is and if she's even    ready for whatever's inside. Willow says she can't go, they don't know where    she's going or how to get her back. Buffy is now forced to make a choice because    the dimensional door is starting to shrink! "How will we get you back?!?"    Willow asks. "Find a way" Buffy says and dives into the doorway just    as it blinks closed!

Buffy gets a job in the fast-paced Fast Food Industry.
|
The morning after, the friends find out such things have happened to them all. They suddenly burst into song again, first wondering what can possibly be the cause for this ("I've Got a Theory") - including a novel idea by Anya ("Bunnies") - and then, guided by Buffy, asserting their ability to deal with it together ("If We're Together"). They further learn that it's not just happened to them; all the people in Sunnydale are forced to sing about their inner feelings ("The Mustard").
|
Buffy and Cordelia are offered as human sacrifices.
|
Giles and Anya journey to another dimension to consult with an oracle-like creature while Buffy prepares to show the Potential Slayers they have the power to defeat The First.

The next day, a group of people gather at a cemetery for Joyce's funeral. Dawn leaves with Tara and Willow while Buffy remains at the grave. Hours later, after the sun has set, Angel appears beside her. Inconsolable regarding the loss of her mother, Dawn reveals to Tara and Willow her intent to perform a resurrection spell. After making love, Anya tells Xander how special it is to be able to create life, and how sex has become much more meaningful. Tara tries to convince Dawn that magic can't be used to alter the natural order of things, such as life and death, and tells her that Wiccans took an oath disallowing resurrection. In the graveyard, Angel does his best to comfort Buffy when she worries how she will continue without Joyce's strength, and if there was any chance she could have saved her mother. Angel offers to stay in town for as long as she needs him, and Buffy asks him to stay with her forever. The two kiss sweetly but pull away, knowing nothing more can happen. Buffy expresses her gratitude, and he stays with her until the sun rises. Ben encounters Jinx, saying that he will not help Glory and he is tired of her games, but accidentally makes a comment that leads Jinx to conclude that the Key is human. Not wanting Glory to learn this fact, Ben stabs the minion with his own knife.

Robin takes the pointed cross and swipes down at Spike,    but Spike blocks the blow and is now very in tune with his surroundings. Back    in human face, he throws Robin's arm back, then kicks Robin back as he stands    up with renewed confidence. Robin asks Spike how he thinks "sorry"    is going to make up for everything. Spike says he wasn't talking to him as he    starts to punch Robin with renewed energy. "I don't give a piss about your    mum. She was a slayer, I was a vampire. That's the way the game is played."    The two exchange blows, but Robin is now on the losing end. Spike says his mom    knew what she was signing up for, but Robin says he didn't sign up for it. Robin    is now incensed but fighting poorly as Spike gives him the blunt truth. She    was a Slayer and like it or not, the job comes first. Robin says that Spike    took his childhood and that he loved her, but Spike continues to point out the    facts, that she didn't love him as much as her mission. Spike grabs Robin's    leg mid kick and throws him hard into some shelves. Panting and bleeding, Robin    says that his mother loved him. "But not enough to quit though, not enough    to walk away" Spike points out, then begins to relate the story of his    love for his own mother and how it led him to turn her. That turning led to    her saying the harsh words, which weighed on Spike for quite a time, but Spike    realized that it was the demon in her talking, not his real mother. Spike didn't    realize it until that moment, and it's because of Robin.

After hearing about the party from Willow, Spike shows up, surprising Buffy. With him, he brings beer and another demon, Clem from kitten poker. Before Buffy has a chance to do anything about Spike's presence, Xander introduces his friend from work, Richard. Buffy goes to show Richard where he can park his car while Spike watches on, clearly jealous. Dawn is anxious for presents to be opened, but Xander and Anya are more concerned with Buffy's progress with Richard and Dawn is yet again treated like an uninformed child. Spike catches Buffy alone and tries to lure her away for some private celebrating, but Buffy's not interested and ignores Spike's jealous jabs at Richard.
|
At a part of the school that is still under construction outside, Buffy walks up to Xander, who asks if everything is fine, if school is stil in session. "Sure, if you're a zombie ghost-thing" Buffy quips. Walking with Buffy, Xander questions if it's Zombies or ghosts, but Buffy doesn't know, just remarking that aside from destroying Dawn's social life, they talked about protecting people, and wanted her to leave. Buffy thinks it's not a co-incidence.

While Wesley, Willow, Oz, and Cordelia head to the Hall of Records, Xander decides to patrol the streets for any further information.  Buffy, in the meantime, heads back home to prepare for an investigation of Mayor Wilkins' office. At the office, the Mayor has a hard time getting Angel's undivided attention.  Angel tries to kill Mayor Wilkins with a letter opener. However, the Mayor reveals his invulnerability to the vampire.  Mayor Wilkins then orders Angel and Faith to take care of the other Slayer in town.  On their way to Buffy's house, Angel and Faith see Xander walking down the street towards them.  Xander tries to find out where they've been, but the only response he gets is a right hook from Angel's fist.  As Xander falls to the pavement, unconscious, Angel and Faith continue walking without missing a step.  Joyce lets both of them into the house. Upstairs, Angel and Faith tell Buffy that they have the Books of Ascension at the mansion, and they want Buffy to be with them when they deliver the books to Giles.

While talking to Xander, Willow sarcastically suggests that Buffy and Spike get married if he's that important. Meanwhile at Giles' place, Spike proposes to Buffy and she accepts.
|
The next morning, Buffy wakes to find a parchment envelope on her pillow, containing a charcoal drawing of herself, eyes closed, asleep. At the library before class, Buffy tells Giles about the drawing and asks if there's a spell to reverse Angel's invitation into her house, something along the lines of "no shoes, no pulse, no service." Xander teases Cordelia when she overreacts because she invited Angel into her car. Leaving the library when Jonathan and another student dare to request books on Stalin, Buffy and the others continue to discuss Angelus' intentions. Because Angelus has an "all-access pass" to her house even when she's not there, Buffy wants to tell her mother the truth so she can protect herself until the reversal spell is in place. Giles vetoes this, urging Buffy not to be goaded by any of Angelus' ploys because, as the Slayer, she doesn't have "the luxury of being a slave to her passions."
|
Willow and Xander go with Giles to the cemetery to find the demon. They are very late and fail to find Barvain. Instead, they find the area incredibly clean, which Willow suggests is the work of the Initiative. She and Xander go on about how thorough the operation is, only to discover that Giles never knew about the Initiative or that Riley and Professor Walsh are behind it. Again feeling incredibly out of the loop and unwanted, Giles sends Willow and Xander away, offering to stay in case anything happens, but after a few seconds realizes it's utterly pointless and dejectedly leaves. Ethan Rayne walks out of the shadows, speaking of interesting things to come, only to be caught when Giles re-enters the mausoleum.

Buffy calms everyone down and then says it's easy to understand, that Willow and Anya have fallen under the love spell. Dawn argues that she's in love, but Buffy tells her to not interrupt and ignores her pleas. Dawn backs away, hurt, as Willow says that she loves RJ the most because she's willing to look past the orientation thing. "I'd kill for him!" Anya blurts out, but Willow answers "you'd kill for a chocolate bar." Buffy smiles at this and says she's the slayer, slayer's kill... she'll kill the principal! Anya says that's gonna be hard to top, but Willow says she can prove her love for RJ with magic. "Yeah, right. Whaddya gonna do? Use Magic to turn him into a girl?" Then, upon realizing she just gave Willow the idea, "Damn." The four girls split up abruptly, each going to do their task in the name of love. Willow heads upstairs, Anya out the door with a "I know what I can do!", Buffy grabs her coat and goes to head out, stopping to comfort a distraught Dawn: "Sorry, Dawnie... you're never gonna get him." Dawn is crushed.

With family and friends causing mayhem in the apartment, Anya and Xander huddle together in the bathroom. Anya's bugged by the fact that Xander's so interested in Riley and Sam's marriage. Xander reassures her that while he's scared of the wedding, he's confident that the marriage will be great and last forever. Buffy and Riley talk privately and Riley asks her if she wants "The Doctor" to be taken out. Verbally admitting to her involvement with the vampire, Buffy denies his offer and accepts the fact that her life sucks and her ex-boyfriend is there to see it. Riley though tells her that struggling with life like a human being doesn't make her any less of a woman. Buffy tries to apologize for what happened when he left, and again Riley acts stoic, hiding his feelings.  The whole gang gathers to say goodbye to Sam and Riley. While Riley explains to Xander where and how his brief and unromantic wedding took place, Sam and Willow confirm that they have each other's e-mail addresses for future contact (although Willow still calls Sam a 'bitch' for Buffy's benefit). A helicopter arrives and carries the married couple off into the night. The next day, Buffy finds Spike at his crypt and although she doesn't care about his being "The Doctor," she brings with her news he does not want to hear. Buffy tells Spike that although she has feelings for him, she can never love him; it would be wrong to keep using him the way she is, so it is over. Spike thinks that this is her usual routine of playing hard to get, but Buffy is serious and walks out with a final goodbye.

At the factory, Spike - knowing the "incredibly brassed off" Slayer will soon hunt them down - is furious with a strangely subdued Angelus. Reminding Spike that Jenny was trying to restore Angelus' soul, Drusilla tries to defend Angelus' actions, but Spike claims he actually prefers the old "Buffy-whipped Angelus". Just as Angelus finishes sneering, "Don't worry, Roller Boy. I've got everything under control," there's an explosive crash and the long dining table erupts in flame. The three vamps instantly recoil and move to escape the roaring fire. At the foot of the catwalk stairs, Angelus suddenly jerks in surprise and tears a crossbow bolt from his shoulder. Tossing his now empty crossbow aside, Giles stalks the length of the room, lights a baseball bat as he passes the flaming table and, while Spike and Drusilla look on, uses it to deliver several stunning blows before the vampire can recover his balance. When Giles raises the torch for a savage overhand chop, Angelus grabs him by the throat and lifts him clear of the floor.

Andrew, taking refuge in the bathroom, describes his own version of "Buffy, Slayer of the Vampyrs" to a video camera (imagining that he is situated in an old library with a roaring fire, dressed in a smoking jacket and holding a pipe, not unlike Masterpiece Theatre). His dramatic narrative of her exploits is cut short when Anya knocks on the bathroom door. He tries to explain his actions, and Anya is unsatisfied (reminding him of Buffy's irritated reaction the previous night, when he had followed her on patrol). He explains his desire to make a record of the events leading up to the apocalypse, in case humans survive, so that they will know what Buffy and her allies did.

Meanwhile, at the Magic Box, Buffy, Anya, Willow, and Xander research the stolen diamond. Willow takes out a computer to look up information, and everyone is happy to see her doing things without the use of magic.

As the Trio prepare to begin the next phase of their plan, Spike arrives, looking for Warren, and coerces him into looking at his chip by threatening a vintage Boba Fett action figure.

Buffy spends the day with her mother in the hospital discussing Joyce's wig options and Buffy's relationship with Riley. Spike wakes Buffy from sleep that night to show her what Riley has been doing. Buffy is shocked to find him in the arms of a female vampire, being fed upon. Graham has persuaded his commanding officer to seek Riley's help in destroying demons for the government. They offer Riley a position in the government's new anti-demon organization, assuring him that they are nothing like the Initiative and exist only to stop demons, not study them. At the Magic Box, Buffy storms in and demands information about humans paying vampires to bite them. Giles (who had seen these kinds of 'brothels' back in his days as Ripper)and Anya confirm that humans will pay vampires to bite them, getting off on the rush of the experience and the danger the vampire might go too far. Buffy is angry that Giles didn't tell her that this kind of place exists, but Giles explains he didn't know this was going on in Sunnydale and even if he did he may not have told her, feeling that the 'victims' are willing and she should remain focused on more imminent threats like Glory. Buffy refuses to back down and gets even more agitated when Xander suggests waiting for Riley.

Spike looks in horror at what he's done. "Sorry..." and pulls the pole out. Buffy rushes to Robby's aid, pulling out her cell phone and dialing 911. All the meanwhile Spike is muttering to himself. Spike goes over the edge again and has lost it. Buffy and Nancy look on as Spike mutters nonscense words. Buffy yells at him to take it somewhere else, but he fires back, saying it's not that easy. He then turns away as if talking to someone else "what the HELL are you screaming about? I can hear you! There's no need to SHOOOOUUUUT!!!" He laughs manically, then says he gets it.. Spike then says that "this" is all just beginning. He crouches near Buffy and looks her straight in the eye "The real headliner's coming and when he hits the stage, all of this will come tumbling in death and screaming, horror and bloodshead." He points towards the ground "And from beneath you, it devours."

London, 1880 - That assertion is belied, however, by the quiet, shy, rather foppish gentleman Spike used to be - a young poet named William who feels disconnected from others in British society. While at a society ball, he works on a love poem, looking for another word for "gleaming", but his unfinished work is snatched from his hands and read out loud, to the rude amusement of the boorish crowd. William is dubbed "William the Bloody" because of his "bloody awful poetry". One listener declares that he would rather have a railroad spike through his head than hear more of William's poetry.

From the other room, she hears a feint wimpering, a girl's voice, saying "I take it back" repeatedly. Going to investigate, Willow opens a closet door and finds a young woman crouching inside, crying, her clothes smeared with blood. She rambles when Willow asks what happenned, going on about there being a party and that everyone is bringing dates, but then when she showed up it was just her, and "them." Her boyfriend invited the woman there to break up with her in front of his frat boy friends as a game, a cruel joke, with the boys laughing and laughing. Willow tries to console the girl a bit as she continues "And I yelled just once... I wish you could all know what it feels like to have your hearts ripped out... just once... I wish... and then it came." Willow asks what came? The woman says "the spider." Willow asks where it is now, as the girl looks up and sees it on the ceiling behind Willow.

Now infront of the fireplace, Willow tosses some spell components    into the roaring fire, saying mystical spell-stuff. She last tosses an egg in,    announcing "and my spell is done" and suddenly the room is beset by    stench! Willow, Xander, Anya, and Dawn all get to their feet with icky-faces    on, waving away the smell, as a golden globe of light starts to swirl and float    in the room, wavering back and fourth. They notice it's not doing anything except    just wavering in mid air and after some jibes from Anya, Willow apologizes for    the failed spell. Dawn heads to the front door to air the place out from the    stench and moments later the golden glow rushes towards her, hitting her in    the chest and sending her flying into the door hard! It looks as if it went    right through her, and it left Dawns chest and stomach glowing just a little    as Xander and Willow look on. "I think it worked!" Willow says, wide-eyed

Buffy catches the teacher turning her head around -- all the way around. Buffy finally figures it out: Miss French is a praying mantis!

Meanwhile, hacker par excellence Willow has found that Blaynes mother has reported him missing.

Nancy is wondering how it's possible her ex was turned into a worm, and Anya says that it's a "You wish it, I dish it" senario and doesn't see the problem, "he had it coming" or so Nancy said.

Xander asks what happens and Buffy says she doesn't know, explaining  that she and Spike were having a 'normal' conversation and then after she went  to talk to the two of them, when she came back, he was different. She heard him  talking to someone and singing. She remembers him talking about a song in the  cellar from before also, and says that when he heard it he became another  person. Xander gets the idea that it's a "trigger", a brain washer term. He  explains that's how the military makes sleeper agents, to get them to attack or  do something when they are triggered to do so. "is this left over from your days  in the army?" Willow asks. "No, this is left over from every Army movie I've  ever seen." he answers. Xander says they've all been seeing ghosts lately, and  wonders if Spike's ghosts have figured out a way to not only haunt him but  control him.

At Giles' apartment his visiting girlfriend, Olivia, is frightened by one of The Gentlemen outside Giles' window. The following morning in a campus classroom, Giles uses a series of overhead transparencies to explain to the others that The Gentlemen steal the townspeople's voices so no one can scream as they gather the hearts they need, and that folklore indicates that they have been vanquished before when a princess screamed: the only thing that will kill them is a live human voice.

In the Initiative control room, Buffy tries to tell Colonel MacNamara that Adam is planning an attack from within his own compound, from a secret lab built for the 314 Project.  Unaware of any of these activities, the Colonel tells her that every inch of the compound is under surveillance, and that a tic couldn't get in without him knowing about it.  Just as he professes his control over the situation, the power goes out, and a soldier at the controls informs everyone that backup generators are not responding, locking them all in the compound.  From his secret control room, Adam opens the containment units, and the demons immediately pounce on two unlucky Initiative doctors.

Pushing Lily behind him, Ken launches into a speech, giving Lily the perfect opportunity to push him off the platform. Buffy tries to escape with all the others through a large iron gate. Ken catches up with her as she moves past the gate, and pushes her through. The gate falls, and he gets his calves impaled by the gate's stakes. Buffy smashes his head in, impersonating a version of Gandhi "if he was really pissed." After the others are safely above ground, the black pool vanishes, leaving an empty, tiled basin behind.

The next morning, breakfast foods in hand, Willow arrives and is shocked to see Oz and Veruca curled up naked together. After Oz gets dressed and, in an uncharacteristic burst of anger, orders Veruca out, he tries to explain things to Willow, but she doesn't want to hear it. After furiously blasting him for choosing a solution that involved him and Veruca locked up together rather than him telling someone what was happening, she asks him if he loved Veruca more than her in that animal way and finally leaves when he doesn't answer.

In Westbury, England, Willow sits in a doorway overlooking the countryside, sitting on a packed suitcase. Giles comes up, saying her taxi is there and waiting. Willow expresses severe doubt about going back, wondering if she's ready. She thinks it might be better if she stays, to which Giles agrees it might be, but he questions why exactly she's scared. Willow starts mentioning the Hellmouth and how it's teeth are now showing, doubting she'll be able to be a "bigger badass" than whatever is coming? Then she wonders if she'll go all veiny and homicidal again... But Giles knows she's just worried about her friends taking her back. Giles says no matter how much time goes by, there is no way of knowing whether they'll take her back or not. "Trust yourself, and the others might follow" he says as they head off towards the taxi.

Moments later Dawn walks over to a table as Buffy gets her attention: "So you got plans later or you just gonna park down by the docks and wait for the fleet to come in?" Dawn is shocked but Buffy's pissed, grabbing her by the arm and laying it out for her. She doesn't like that she lied about going to the library, that she didn't tell Buffy she was going out on a date, and third: "Anna Nicole Smith thinks you look tacky." Dawn says RJ thinks she looks good. Buffy says she's going to have a word with him about that, but Dawn stops her, saying she's not going to embarass her, she can do what she wants. Buffy thinks not, and Dawn uses the infamous "What, so you think you're mom now?" line. "I am not, and I am glad she is not here to see you like this" Buffy says, which hurts both girls for a moment. Dawn starts in with her rant, saying that Buffy is jealous that someone finally likes her and not her Slayer-sister, and she doesn't care what Buffy thinks. Dawn starts to head back but Buffy grabs her by the waste and says "no no no, you are NOT going out on that dance floor." Dawn, in a huff, grabs her coat off a nearby chair after a momentary stare-down and leaves the Bronze.

Dawn says she knows the creature is there as she starts to cast her spell. She looks from a book as candles are lit before her and she grinds something in a pestle and motar. She comments that she has to get rid of the creature because her mother needs to talk to her. She reaches in and grabs some glitterdust, throwing it in the air and commands "i cast you from this place!" She is thrown, sliding across the floor into the far wall, but she continues to throw the dust and speak the spell, which gets the creature angry. It growls and the room comes alive. A slash appears on her face, windows break, the candles are snuffed, carnage!

"It's about power" says Buffy as she and Dawn face a vampire JUST rising up from the grave. As the vamp struggles to free itself from the ground, Buffy tosses Dawn a stake and asks her who has the power? Dawn says she's got the stake, but Buffy says the stake is not power. Dawn starts to argue a little defensively, pointing out that the vamp is new, but then she rolls her eyes under her older sister's glare and says "He does." Buffy then starts into a speech about how much stronger a vampire is than Dawn and that she should ALWAYS be careful, when the Vampire interrupts: "Excuse me, I think I'm stuck... My foot's caught on a root or something..." "So, he's got the power..." Dawn says sarcastically as Buffy goes and lifts the stuck vampire out of his grave with one hand. The vampire thanks her, then begins to threaten Buffy, but she quickly grabs the vamp by the throat and tells him that he doesn't wanna mess with her, then she points out Dawn. The vamp turns to attack Dawn as Buffy continues her "speech" about power and how the vamp has it. The vamp attacks Dawn, who dodges and dive rolls, sending the vampire flying. Dawn grabs her stake and stabs the vampire... but she misses the heart! The vamp throws her away and gets up. Dawn grabs another stake from a weapons bag and attacks, but is instantly grabbed by the vampire, who goes to sink his teeth in her neck.

In a funeral home at night, we hear two men commenting on how good a woman looks as she lays in a coffin. Other coffins in the room are revealed as the men leave for the night, turning out the lights. In the now dark room, both of the other coffins slowly open, one right after the other. Xander is blinded by a flashlight-weilding Buffy, who hear a knocking. Walking over to a fourth, smaller kid's coffin, they open it up to let Dawn climb out, complaining about how she's not the smallest and shouldn't get the kid coffin. Xander thinks it's too much trouble to hide out for half an hour in coffins for one lousy vampire, but Buffy says "Vamprie by vampire, it's the only way I know how." Buffy muses about recent worries (approaching Big Bad, Willow's uneasy return, high school on Hellmouth, her new councelling job) as the three approach the dead woman in the coffin. They also remark that she looks peaceful, until her eyes pop open. "I am not peaceful." says the new vampire. Buffy offers to help and simply stakes the Vampire. Buffy closes the empty coffin and quips "I always thought closed caskets were more tasteful anyway..."

Spike notes the myriad dangers of roaming around alone at night, and then he accepts Dawn's offer to let him tag along. With Spike's assistance, Dawn breaks into the shop and finds the book that she had seen Giles hide earlier. Reading Giles's entries about the Key, she reads that it is outside human perception and can only be seen by psychics and mad-men, causing her to remember being confronted about not being real by crazy people. Although Dawn gets a really bad feeling, she nevertheless keeps reading and finds out that the Key can also be seen by snakes and dogs, and she remembers how Glory's snake seemed to have a special interest in her. Dawn has already realized the truth as Spike takes over the reading and confirms what it now obvious to her... the monks, seeking to make sure the slayer would protect the Key no matter what, sent it to her transformed into a sister. Spike is surprised, as Dawn's world starts to crumble.

Episode Synopsis by: Michelle Albuquerque
|
Meanwhile, Giles and Anya return from the Beljoxa's Eye's dimension, where it is revealed that the glitch in the Slayer line was due to Buffy's second revival the previous year.

On a small theater stage, a group of about 12 Wiccans are    arranged in a circle as they try to meditate and summon... something by candlelight,    as Willow and Kennedy stand in a doorway and interrupt. The leader of the Wiccan    circle asks who they are. Willow/Warren says that it's her, Willow, that they've    met previously. She/he briefly introduces Kennedy, who nods. Willow/Warren looks    on at the slightly stunned group as she is surpised at how the campus Wiccans    have come from bake sales. "Ah, no, we still do that too, second tuesday    of every month" says the Wiccan leader, who then says she's still having    a hard time believing it's Willow. "um... it's actually her" comes    a familiar voice from the circle. Amy stands up and says that she knows her.    Willow/Warren looks a little surprised and maybe a hint scared as Amy gently,    with remorse, tries to apologise for her past actions and says that she's gettting    help from the Wiccan group. Vaughne (the Wiccan leader) says that Amy is doing    much better, but Amy says it's ok, she should apologise. Just then the mood    turns into one of wonder as Amy asks how it happened, looking at Willow/Warren.    Willow/Warren says that that she's run into this problem and can't seem to shake    it, and that she came there for help. Amy says that the group is into healing    the life force and stuff, not real magic, which bums Willow/Warren, but then    Amy says they'll try.

Spike further describes how, mere months later, he became far more assertive, already using his new name "Spike," speaking in a more forceful, working class accent, and preying upon innocents not for sustenance but for fun, calling too much attention to the group as far as Angelus was concerned. Angelus preferred meticulous, artistic kills, and Spike's love of brawls and riots required them to flee London. Spike mocked Angelus' attitude, and the older vampire lost control, almost staking him, but Spike only laughed at having provoked Angelus to such an extent. Infuriated, Angelus remarked that maybe one day an angry crowd would teach Spike the folly of his excesses, adding "That...or the Slayer," a comment which instantly intrigued Spike. In the present, Spike reveals that, upon learning of the Slayer, he became obsessed with her; unlike other vampires, who feared the Slayer, Spike actively sought her out, craving the challenge she would provide.

Later that evening in the library, Willow is having a hard time tutoring Buffy in the history of the Civil War, since they are both distracted by gloom over boys - Buffy because she doesn't want to slay Angel and Willow because she wants to attract Xander. Lurking in the stacks, Darla eavesdrops before going to Buffy's house, where she cons Joyce into inviting her in by claiming to be yet another study buddy of Buffy's.

"Look at the fine work Xander did    on replacing that window sash. You can't even tell it's new, it blends in so    well. He's extrordinary."

Riley intercepts the mayday call on his radio and goes to the scene to help the endangered soldiers, only to find that Angel is the culprit.

"Not that this is    the end" Xander corrects himself, but Buffy knew what he meant. Xander    just wanted to be at her side, but Buffy says he will be, he is her strength    and the reason she's gotten that far. That's why she needs him to do "this"    for her. Xander finally agrees. Buffy adds that she doesn't want him around    weapons cause he's a clutz.

After wading through dozens of people she's never even met before, Buffy finds Willow near the band.  Buffy pulls her over to a quieter area and asks Willow if she's been avoiding her.  Willow denies this, then immediately leaves Buffy alone and heads back to where he band is playing.  On her way upstairs, Buffy briefly talks to Xander and Cordelia, who are lost in their own world of nonstop smoochies.  Buffy then stops outside the kitchen, where Joyce and Pat are talking about having Buffy back home.  Buffy overhears her mom talking about how much more difficult it is now that Buffy's home.  Unable to take much more animosity from her closest friends and family, Buffy goes up to her bedroom and starts packing her bag again.

Later that night, Giles asks Willow for specifics regarding the spell she cast to bring Buffy back to life. Willow, seeking Giles' praise, begins to boast about how scary the spell was, but Giles quickly takes the wind out of her sails by reminding her why such spells aren't practiced, including the possible consequences. He notes that he left her in charge of the group because he thought she was the most responsible, which he now sees is clearly not the case. Although he maintains a stereotypically British calm through most of his speech, Giles ultimately loses control and thunders that Willow is lucky to be alive after casting such a spell, calling her a "rank, arrogant amateur." Failing to see that Giles' anger is at least partially motivated by his deep affection for her, Willow stands up for herself, even threatening Giles, however he reminds her that the gang still has no idea where Buffy has been or what she has been through. Spike finds Buffy on the back porch and the two exchange small talk about life and money. Giles and Dawn both have trouble sleeping and go for a snack.

Cranking of gears and chains is heard as Spike slowly rises  up and is inverted, faceing down towards the ground. "I think it's about time we  brought some athority to our presence. Now, Spike, do you wanna see what a REAL  vampire looks like?" Morphy-Buffy says as Spike is now suspended in air, blood  dripping easily from varous wounds on his body, each drawn in mystic ruine  patters. His blood falls onto the seal of Danzathar, which suddenly springs to  life with the blood's touch. The corners of the seal start to glow, and each of  the pentacle's points fold up slowly, forming a pyramid which slowly sinks into  the ground. The the remaining five sections of the seal slowly sink into the  ground also. Morphy-Buffy watches with a smile as something starts to rise up  out of the new hole. A sickly , black, skelital clawed hand reaches up. Then and  arm and body are seen, dressed in a black fabric. It is a truly disgusting  vampiric image that slowly rises from the Earth, far more hideous than anything  else we've seen. (think the vampire from "nosferatu"). He growls evilly and  raises his hands in the air in celebration.

Deflector Shields up!" says Andrew as the door suddenly bursts open (and may I just interject her that you really don't have to look hard at all to see the black wire/rope connected to the door that pulls it open. Very, very badly done). The ubervamp enters and turns towards the group, all huddled together in the living room, but Willow completes the spell and a light blue-ish barrier springs up in front of the Ubervamp, who starts punching and clawing at it! Willow's eyes are black and it is obvious that she's struggling to hold the barrier up. She says it's strong and she can't hold it long. The SIT's wonder what to do. Buffy says simply "Run!

"Ampata" speaks eloquently of the princess's suffering and difficulty in obeying her duty to die at 16, the same age Buffy is. Buffy is primarily miffed that she can't go to the dance because she must help Giles with her Slaying duties and save lives, and Ampata is occupied with eagerly anticipating the dance.

Buffy agrees; he truly has become pathetic. Spike retorts by saying that they sicken him; the last time he had seen them, they were fighting to the death, and now they were acting like nothing had happened. They insist that they are just friends now, but Spike knows better. He tells them, "You'll fight, and you'll shag, and you'll hate each other till it makes you quiver, but you'll never be friends. I may be love's bitch", he says, "but at least I'm man enough to admit it."  Xander wakes up to find that he and Willow are locked in the basement of the factory. They discuss what will happen to them: Willow explains that either she casts the spell and Spike kills them, or she refuses to cast the spell, and Spike kills them. Xander demands a third option, so Willow suggests that Spike might have gotten so drunk that he will pass out and forget about them, leaving them to starve to death; she notes that this last possibility is their best option. Deciding that the high probability of death is a mitigating factor, Willow and Xander kiss just in time for Oz and Cordelia to find them.

Adam is no more.  As Riley looks on, Buffy levitates Adam's power supply from her hand, and dissolves it into thin air.

The social worker comes round to check on how Buffy's doing  - while the living room is scattered with Willow's old spell ingredients and objects. Buffy digs herself into a deep hole by saying "It's magic weed." Spike, in the daytime but using a blanket to cover him, comes over to her house wanting his lighter back. Then he leaves after worsening the situation, calling Buffy Goldilocks.

Part 1
|
While patrolling, Buffy is confronted by a vampire who condenses from a mist and introduces himself as Count Dracula. She is flattered when he tells her she is known throughout the world, but discomforted when he says her power is rooted in darkness. When she tries to stake the legendary vampire, he disappears. Xander and Willow arrive to see Dracula before he turns into a bat and flies away. The women discuss how amazing Dracula is, and Riley and Xander both express their jealousy towards the infamous "Dark Prince". Willow makes a lame attempt to attract attention to Giles and his usefulness, but the gang seems oblivious.
|
(The next scene is a bit back and fourth, with Robin being    confused on the banter between Buffy and Giles concerning Spike's chip and the    initiative, Spikes Soul, and the trigger the First uses on Spike. Basically    it boils down to Robin thinking that Spike's trigger isn't active anymore because    the military gave him a soul... for a moment. Robin also learns that Spike has    been triggered into killing again, dispite having the soul and the chip. Giles    apparently has brought something that will help to defuse the Trigger.)
|
Buffy freaks as Kendra identifies herself as the Slayer. They realize that Kendra was summoned as the new Slayer when Buffy died -- temporarily drowned, that is. Kendra, too, knows that evil is coming. Near death at daybreak, Angel is dragged from the cell by the guy from the bar -- he dumps him in a sewer and turns him over to Spike and Drusilla. When the new moon comes that night, they will perform the ritual they figured out from the transcriber and Angel will die.
|
Buffy was waiting for Stephan Korshak to rise as a vampire when Angel appeared. They ended up arguing over their relationship, or lack thereof (along with Angel's inability to express his jealousy of Xander because Buffy danced suggestively with him in the previous episode), and Angel decided to leave. When Buffy tried to follow him, she fell face first into an open grave. A body was apparently dragged out from it earlier.
|
Anya transforms back into a vengeance demon and sets out to punish Xander for leaving her at the altar. However, she finds she can only exact magical vengeance for others.
|
After being bested in a fight by an ordinary vampire, Buffy asks Spike to explain how he killed two Slayers many years earlier.

Buffy and Faith go out and find Balthazar, an obese and ugly demon that must live in a large pool of water and constantly be kept wet, since only his amulet would give him the strength to stand up again. At a loss for weapons against a large group of vampires, they break into Meyer Sports and Tackle. Faith continues to expound on her philosophy of being a Slayer to Buffy. "Life as a Slayer is very simple. Want, take, have" while helping herself to items. Buffy, continuing to be swept away by Faith's brazen recklessness, also steals some weapons. The police arrive and arrest them, but in the car, the two Slayers kick down the metal grate separating them from the cops, causing the car to crash and the cops to be (mildly) injured. The following morning, Buffy checks the local newspaper for any news regarding the accident, but finds nothing. The Mayor is attacked by one of Balthazar's vampires, who is captured by Mr. Trick.
|
The next night, Xander tries to keep Spike at home, but gets knocked out for his trouble. At the Bronze, Spike asks around about the woman he'd been there with the other night. A woman approaches and flirts with him; she turns Vamp on him and offers to pick off the crowd. He refuses and she attacks, insisting that since he sired her, he ought to give her a hand. Horrified, he stakes her.
|
Still a bit down, Dawn says "They can handle it."    "Yeah, they're special. No doubt." Xander says, sitting next to the    desk "And the amazing thing is, not one of them will ever know. Not even    Buffy."    "Know what?"

Giles says that the trigger is still active, and Buffy says    it's because of that song which nobody remembers. "It was boring, old and    English, just like You.." A glare from Giles makes Buffy continue "...    ule Brenner. Yule Brenner. A British Yule Brenner." Robin asks what Giles    brought to help with Spike's trigger. Giles says it's something that will require    a bit of magic.

Anya grants a girl's wish for revenge on her cruel boyfriend that results in a massacre. Troubled by the deaths, Anya looks back on her life as both human and vengeance demon and tries to work out which world she really belongs in.

"You can't be dead! Where's my infinite riches?" says Peter as he crawls over to Avilas's remains. Avilas then snaps at Peter... one last gasp... biting Peter in the shoulder. "Aaaahh, it bit me!" Avilas then explodes into a firey burst and then into nothingness. Peter begs Buffy for help, but Buffy walks out of the library holding up a scared, crying Cassie "Sorry, my office hours are ten to four." Buffy says.
|
Giles returns to Sunnydale, protecting three teenage girls who have the potential to one day become slayers. He reveals that the First intends to kill them all so that there will be no one to replace Buffy after she is dead. As Buffy searches for the captured Spike, she faces the First's assassin - a new breed of vampire more powerful than any she has fought before.
|
Buffy is attacked by the mysterious girl and during the fight learns that her name is Kendra and that she is a Vampire Slayer. Apparently, Buffy's temporary death at the hands of the Master was enough to activate the next Slayer, and she has come to Sunnydale. They call a truce, and Giles convinces them to work together to save Angel from Spike and Drusilla.

The crazy people in the hospital break their restraints, Tara wants to get out, & the crazy Knight wanting to go somewhere is killed by another Knight saying that the Beast took his mind, but that it will never know "the taste of your heart". Buffy feels bad about running from Glory, that it was an unslayerlike thing to do. Giles tells Buffy that it was doing what she needed to do to follow her heart- something that made him proud. While Ben is attending to Giles, Buffy talks to the General. He tells Buffy about Glory & Dawn. He thinks Dawn is an object, but Buffy insists that Dawn's her sister- that it's Dawn's life to live now, however she came by it, it's her life to live. The General insists that it must be destroyed, it's the only way to stop the chaos. He says that Glory was a God with two other Gods in a demon dimension, but that she became so powerful & evil that the other two Gods feared her. They thought she would get rid of them & alone reign, so they decided to strike first. They won just barely &, as punishment, threw her into our dimension- so that she would live & die trapped inside a human, a male created just as her prison. If someone were to kill the man, she would die. It's her only weakness. But the identity of the man is unknown. Dawn asks the General about the Key. He tells her that it opens the gates to dimensions.

After notifying Giles of Buffy's return, Willow and Tara go to bed and talk about the spell and changes in Buffy. In her room, Buffy looks at the pictures surrounding her and they briefly turn to pictures of skulls. During the night, Willow and Tara are visited in their room by a Buffy who yells at them and hints at Willow killing the deer in "Bargaining, Part One". When the girls get up to investigate, Buffy's asleep in her room and neither knows the source of the incident. A moving lump appears in the ceiling, motivating Willow to call Xander. In the background while Xander talks, Anya enters the room with a knife and smokey eyes, slitting her cheek before collapsing as the lump travels across the floor.

Bodies of girls killed in traffic accidents are being dug from their graves. The culprits are two science students, Chris and Eric, using pieces of the girls to create a bride for Chris' monstrous brother, Daryl. The only thing the young monsters need now is Cordy's head-can the Scooby Gang members arrive in time to save her?

Buffy notifies her poetry professor that she is dropping out of college so that she may take care of Dawn.

At the Bronze that night, Xander is still entertaining his new female acquaintance, though it's clear that she's far more interested in the car than she is in him. Xander meets Angel, who is looking for Buffy to discuss the Sisterhood of Jhe. Angel dismisses Xander's offer to help, telling him it would be safer for Xander to keep out of the way. As he leaves, "car girl" still in tow, Xander drives into a parked car. Jack gets out of the car and threatens Xander with a knife. Before Jack can seriously injure Xander, a cop arrives and interrupts. Xander lies to the cop, telling him that the two were just "rasslin'." Surprised yet grateful, Jack offers to let Xander be his "wheel man" and drive him, and later Jack's friends, wherever they need to go. It turns out that Jack's friends are no longer alive, and the two go to to the graveyard so Jack can "raise" his friends from the dead. Xander spots Giles, who was unsuccessfully trying to get help from the Spirit Guides. Desperate to leave Jack and his undead friends behind, he begs to help Giles, but to no avail; the gang still thinks that Xander is "better out of the way." Jack finishes raising his three friends and they leave with their "wheel man."

Willow tells Buffy that Cordelia survived the fall, but is in the hospital, having lost a lot of blood. When Xander takes her flowers, Cordelia tells him to stay away from her. Buffy tells Angel that the only way they can continue to see each other is if he tells her that he does not love her, something he cannot do. A happy and confident Spike is seen driving out of Sunnydale on his way to find Drusilla.

Buffy grabs Dr. Angleman, demanding information about 314. Riley arrives to help Buffy, still unwilling to accept Professor Walsh's sinister motives. Adam drops a dead body to the floor, revealing his presence.

Buffy goes to the deserted costume shop to try to help Ethan but he knocks her out, ties her up and puts the mark of Eyghon on her. He then pours acid on his own tattoo so that Eyghon will take Buffy instead of him. Jenny enters, now looking completely demonic, and approaches Buffy. But Buffy breaks free and starts fighting. Angel enters suddenly and chokes Jenny: Eyhgon's spirit then leaves her body and enters Angel's, since he's really dead (which happened to be Willow's plan all along). Eyghon fights Angel's demon, and is beaten. Jenny returns back to normal, but Ethan escapes.

Cain busies himself casting silver bullets for the hunt. Willow visits Oz right before sundown. Oz is about to chain himself up, but lets Willow in the house. Her rant about the mixed signals he is sending is interrupted by him changing into a werewolf. She flees the house screaming, Oz in pursuit. Cain hears the wolf's cry and joins the hunt. The werewolf is distracted by a scent which Cain set as a trap, and Willow escapes and then finds Giles and Buffy, who are about to start the hunt for Oz with a tranquilizer gun. All parties meet in a clearing in the forest, and in the scuffle, it is Willow who shoots Oz, saving everybody. Buffy bends Cain's gun with her bare hands using Slayer strength, and tells him to leave Sunnydale.

Joyce is hanging up a Nigerian mask given to her by a friend at the gallery while Buffy finishes unpacking. She reluctantly allows Buffy to go to find her friends, who are coordinating a vampire hunt via walkie-talkies. Buffy stumbles upon the Scoobies and assists them in staking. They're shocked at her sudden and unannounced return. Everyone heads to Giles' apartment, where he puts on the usual 'stiff upper lip' when he sees that Buffy has returned. Later, everyone discusses the news that Buffy is no longer wanted for Kendra's murder and also speculate on where Buffy went during the summer while, unseen by the others, in the kitchen Giles nearly cries from the relief that Buffy has returned safely.

"WELL now... you girls are just burning with righousness,    aren you? You think you're blazing like suns when really you're just burning    like match-sticks in the wind." Caleb walks out from the shadows as everything    is brought to an abrupt hault. He walks up to Buffy (with Spike at her side)    and confronts her, wondering if his "boys" didn't tire them out too    much? Buffy says she heard he has something of hers. Caleb hopes that Buffy    liked his message, but comments that he ruined his knife and he might have to    get a new truck because of the blood. Then Caleb looks at Buffy with a slight    hint of awe, almost introducing himself to her, building her up as the "one    and only" all powerful Slayer. "The Slayer must indeed be powerful"    he says, then out of nowhere backhands her with ease. The blow is incredible,    sending Buffy flying up into the air and hard against the wall a good 20 feet    away. "So... what else you got?"
|
After a gruesome welcome to Tokyo, Buffy and Willow capture one of the Japanese vampires and learn of a sinister plan to revert all slayers into ordinary humans. Then, while Dawn goes "Godzilla" all over the streets of Tokyo, Buffy's team stumbles into Toro's trap.
|
The Master bites Buffy, and she drops into a puddle. This allows him to break through to the "other side." Xander and Angel find Buffy, and Xander is able to revive her using CPR. Meanwhile, Cordelia, Willow and Ms. Calendar find themselves driving through a sea of vampires in the streets. They try to escape to the library, but the undead follow them. As they try to fight them off, a huge, horrific monster comes up through the floor and attacks them. Buffy makes it back to the school and fights the Master on the roof. She throws him through the roof window and he falls through, getting impaled on the way down. He disintegrates, and the monster and the vampires disappear with him.
|
The next morning, Buffy unveils her plan to the rest of the Scoobies asking their opinion. They're all shocked at the radical sounding plan, but Giles declares it to be "bloody brilliant" allowing him and Buffy to reconcile their recent arguments. Willow is concerned since she'll be required to perform the spell required, having never done anything so powerful before. Buffy then reveals the plan to the potentials off-camera. Afterward, Willow expresses her concerns about using magic again to Kennedy. She says this is the most powerful magic she will have attempted and asks Kennedy to kill her if it turns bad. Faith and Principal Wood also have a discussion while preparing the school for the battle. Wood demonstrates that he understands her defensiveness over getting emotionally involved with men and asks her to give him a chance after the battle. During the night, Buffy goes to the basement, where she apparently spends her last night with Spike.

Giles seems to be bonding with Kendra, making Buffy feel left out. Now that there's a spare slayer, Buffy considers giving up the business. At Buffy's house, Cordelia chats merrily with the cosmetics guy until she realizes he has bugs crawling all over him. He turns into a huge pile of them, sending Cordelia and Xander into hiding, and they fight over what to do. In the heat of the argument, they kiss passionately (?!). They manage to escape and speed off in Cordy's car. At Sunnydale High, Willow chats with Oz, her male computer nerd counterpart, about their similar Career Fair paths. A police woman supervising the fair suddenly opens fire on Buffy and accidentally shoots Oz, but Kendra comes to Buffy's rescue. When the gang assembles in the library, Giles announces he's figured out the ritual: Angel will die that night. Buffy and Kendra go to the bar to try to get help finding Angel, but Kendra bails, convinced that Angel is evil. Meanwhile, Drusilla is having a field day with her ex-tormentor Angel, dousing him with holy water and watching him writhe in pain. The Bar Guy leads Buffy to the church, which is filled with evil Tenaka bounty hunters. Buffy watches in horror as Drusilla holds onto the tied-up Angel, sapping his power. As the policewoman assassin goes to shoot Buffy, Kendra enters to save her. Willow, Xander, Cordelia and Giles burst in and help, too. Xander and Cordelia wait for Bug Guy to, well, bug out, then they pour glue all over him and stomp on the helpless creatures. Buffy releases Angel, but Spike sets the room on fire and grabs Dru. Before they're able to escape, Buffy hurls something at them and sends them crashing into a huge organ, squooshing them both. The charm-free Kendra leaves town, and Buffy is the Number One Slayer once again. But all is not well. Emerging from the rubble in the church is Drusilla, now fully vamped out and strong enough to carry the injured Spike to safety. She's back, and she's bad.

On patrol later in the day, Buffy runs into Forrest outside the mouth of a cave.  The two reluctantly agree to patrol the cave together after Forrest expresses his dislike for Buffy.  Just as Forrest accuses Buffy of ruining Riley's military career and Buffy learns that she may have been Riley's first serious Girlfriend, Adam interrupts their growing squabble.  Adam quickly proves to be too much for both of them, and kills Forrest when he tries to fight back.  Realizing she is outmatched, Buffy runs out of the cave, but falls in her haste and knocks herself unconscious on some rocks outside the cave.  Later that night, Spike delivers the 'stolen' disks to Giles' house.  He gives the disks to Willow to encode and demands his money from Giles, who is well into a drinking binge after Spike's last pep talk.  Spike immediately moves in on Willow, telling her that Buffy and Xander have been talking about her and Tara's relationship as a just a phase in Willow's "trendy" behavior.  Willow is noticeably distracted from her work decoding the encrypted disk, and begins to doubt her friends' loyalty and honesty.

Back in the library, Giles tells Buffy that the Watchers Council has agreed to allow Faith to remain in Sunnydale and he will act as her Watcher until a new one is sent. Buffy finally reveals to the others that Willow's restoration spell had cured Angel just before she was forced to kill him. She tells them all the details, and Willow and Giles proceed to stare at her. Giles says that it will help with the binding spell, and Willow empathizes with Buffy and apologizes. When Buffy leaves, Willow once again approaches Giles about the spell, only to be told that the spell doesn't exist, and he was merely trying to get Buffy to talk about what had happened.
|
The rumbling starts to subside as Faith tells Robin to ease    off the gas a little. Out on a desert road, the bus screeches to a hault and    Buffy drops down onto the road, looking at the devistation behind them (which    we cannot see yet). She then looks down the opposite direction at the road that    continues off into the distance.
|
Buffy exits the office and bumps into another student, spilling the contents of her purse over the floor. Xander sees that and helps Buffy, introducing himself. She leaves without her stake, which Xander pockets because he called out to her, but she had already walked away. In history class, Buffy is helped by Cordelia, who afterward tests her "coolness factor", allowing Buffy skipping the written as Buffy had just moved to Sunnydale from Los Angeles. To Buffy's horror, Cordelia humiliates an awkward Willow at the water fountain. Inside the library, Mr. Giles places a book titled Vampyr in front of Buffy after realizing who she was. A stunned Buffy makes a hasty exit.
|
Cordelia's pain over Xander's betrayal summons Anyanka (Emma Caulfield), a vengeance demon who grants wishes to scorned women. Cordelia wishes that Buffy had never come to Sunnydale, and constructs an alternate reality where the Master (Mark Metcalf) rose from the dead and the Harvest took over Sunnydale. Giles discovers this in the alternate reality and realizes he is able to reverse the events.

The plan doesn't work, as Buffy arrives in a short leather trench coat and heels, continuing her quest to seduce Xander. Even so, he decides not to take advantage of the situation, and politely asks Buffy to back off. Suddenly, Amy turns up and, claiming Xander loves her, she and Buffy get into a fight. Xander can only watch helplessly. Then, Amy performs a spell and turns Buffy into a rat. Giles and Jenny return, and while Jenny and Amy glare at each other - with Amy almost turning Jenny into a rat as well - the two men try to capture the Buffy-slash-rat. The situation gets even worse when Oz shows up and punches Xander in the face for rejecting Willow the night before, as she was on the phone with him all night, crying. The distraction leads the Buffy-rat to escape into the basement. Giles angrily tells Xander to go home before he does any more damage, and asks Oz to help him look for Buffy-rat.

Unbeknownst to Buffy , Angel  lurks in the shadows of Sunnydale trying to protect her and keep her safe, while her perfect Thanksgiving feast is disrupted by an army of Chumash Indians, the original inhabitants of Sunnydale, whose spirits have come alive to recreate the wrongs that were done to their people.

While Buffy is determined to kill Anya, Xander cannot believe she could do such a thing, as he is still in love with her. Anya, meanwhile, is feeling deep remorse about the event - even though Halfrek tries to convince her that what she did was a work of art.
|
Buffy talks to Willow about what happened with Parker, wondering if every guy she sleeps with will end up evil the next morning. Willow assures her that she just made a mistake, but despite how badly he's treated her Buffy is still hung up on him and wonders if it was something about her that put him off despite Willow insisting it isn't. Buffy decides to take a walk and as she does, so do Anya and Harmony. They all walk separately around campus, their minds very much on the men in the lives and their conflicting feelings about them.

The next day at Giles' place, Willow helps Giles with his computer. He is eager to begin archiving a large collection of old texts, but Willow isn't too willing to get started. She suggests that winter is the better archiving season, not summer. Giles confides in Willow that he plans to go back to England. He wants the archiving done so that the gang will have all the information at their fingertips. He makes her promise not to tell anyone, especially Buffy. A shocked Willow pleads with him to stay, but he says that Buffy obviously doesn't need him anymore and that he's quite proud of her. Willow argues that everyone else, including herself, needs him to watch over them. Giles tells her that they will be fine and they can stay in touch. He plans to tell Buffy about his return to England soon.

The gang brainstorms how to kill Adam, and a difficult paralysis spell  which must be incanted in Sumerian  within striking distance of the victim  is suggested.

Daytime in an alley and Anya and Giles confront Torg, a demon who is emptying garbage from a restaurant he works at. Torg is hurt by Anya, who apparently had an "evening" with her and was then rejected. Anya asks for help in frustraition, then tells Torg that she'll sleep with him if he'll give them the information they need. Torg is disgusted by the idea "Ugh... you're human! The way you look now, i wouldn't touch you for all the kittens in china." Having enough, Giles interrupts, saying that if Torg gives them the info, the Slayer won't come and destroy the restaurant and kill all the demons within.

Back at Giles', Willow finds an old newspaper article detailing the use of the Initiative house as an orphanage back in the 50's.  When they discover that the Mistress of the house, Mrs. Holt, is still living in Sunnydale, they decide to pay her a visit.  The sweet old lady that begins telling them about her "children" turns out to have a deep rooted psychosis.  Apparently she would punish the children for, what she considered, their impure hormonal thoughts.  To cleanse the girls she would cut their hair off and to cleanse the boys she would hold them underwater in the bath.  After Giles gives Mrs. Holt an earful for emotionally damaging children, the group storms out. In the hallway, Giles explains to them that whatever is going on at the house is a result of the energy released from the deep emotional trauma and spiritual damage to the children.  The people they were seeing, like the girl who ran through Anya and the boy in the bathtub, were poltergeists rather than ghosts. They were released by the damage done to the children's souls so many years ago.  The anomaly must have been caused by the intense sexual energy of Riley and Buffy lately.  Giles explains that since Riley and Buffy are the catalyst, they will die if the poltergeist leaves before their sexual energy runs out.

At the hospital where Giles was getting care, Xander fills him in on Willow's plans. Spike reports that Glory has left her apartment. Dawn reveals to Glory that she remembers the transformation from Ben; this really worries Glory, as it implies Ben is closer to the surface than before. She asks to have Ben taken out of her body, but it is the punishment she must face for her crime. In Buffy's mind, Willow watches Buffy  shelve a book at the magic shop, followed by Buffy's memory of the First Slayer telling her that "death is  gift." At her house, Buffy calmly acknowledges that death is her gift, before going to Dawn's room and smothering the young girl with a pillow, much to Willow's horror.

In the library, Giles shows Buffy a variety of crystals, ostensibly to teach her how to identify them. Later, on patrol, Buffy's strength suddenly deserts her and she is nearly killed by a vampire. Buffy reports the problem to Giles and demonstrates her poor performance when throwing knives at a target. At home, Buffy is disappointed to find that her father is too busy to take her to the ice show for her 18th birthday; she suggests to Giles that he could take her instead. Giles has Buffy stare at a crystal until she falls into a trance, then injects her with a mysterious substance. Meanwhile, Quentin Travers, the head watcher, sets up an extreme test for the slayer, assisted by two men named Hobson and Blair.

At the fraternity house, the boys are getting ready for the party. One of them finds a symbol in an old book to paint on the floor of the party room. Anya goes to see Xander, and again wants to know where their relationship is heading. He agrees that they're somewhat dating and invites her to the Halloween party that night, telling her to dress in something scary. Buffy visits Professor Walsh and asks for her missed assignments, but is met with less than kind reception from the strict teacher. Riley, however, gives her the assignment and then tells her to have fun on Halloween. Oz and Xander carry the equipment for a sound system to the fraternity house and Oz installs it while some of the guys paint the symbol on the ground. Oz cuts his hand, and some of his blood spills onto the symbol making it pulse with energy - and turning a fake spider lying on it into a real one.

Andrew still sits tied up as he remarks he has a bad feeling  about the situation and that he'd better be untied. Buffy wonders how that will  help them. Andrew admits that they probably think of him as some sort of evil  bad guy but he's not anymore.

Tension in the room is now very thick. Buffy notes how Spike looks different. Nancy asks who he is, to which Xander says it's Buffy's "ex." Spike says he doesn't want to be there, but he kinda has to be, and after a threat from Xander to be escorted out, he says he'll be quick. Spike then explains that he just needs to talk to Buffy for a moment, and admits that he was out of his head in the school basement before, but he's better now. Dawn approaches Buffy, questioning her on why she didn't say she saw Spike in the basement. Buffy says now's not the time, she'll talk about it later. Dawn says "fine, whatever" and says it's usually when it's only convinient for Buffy to talk about it, which Xander agrees with. Spike starts to defend Buffy, but Xander tells him to shut up.

Spike is the first to dust his with the handle of a shovel, then at Buffy's    request goes to help out Robin who is not doing so hot with his. As the vamp    stands over Robin snarling, he suddenly becomes dust and we see Spike standing    behind with the shovel handle. "Little tip mate... the stake's your friend.    Don't be afraid to use it" Spike tells Robin as he helps the silent Slayer    Son to his feet. Robin has a very cold look on his face which makes Spike question    it, but Robin silently shakes it off. Spike walks off to help Buffy (who is    pummelling her vamp silly in the background) as Robin grips a stake in his hand    in such quiet anger that his hand bleeds. "Just waiting for my moment"    he mutters.

She is unable to escape and is stabbed by one of the figures. She cries out in pain as her life slowly slips away. The assassins re-sheath their daggers and depart.

Buffy finds Whistler in Giles' apartment and they discuss Angel's reversion to Angelus. He tells her no one foresaw Buffy, that Angel was supposed to be stopping Acathla, not bringing him forth, but that was before Buffy erased his soul. He asks her what she intends to do about this, and tells her that in the end, she's all she's got. He tells her the sword is not enough, that you must know how to use it. Buffy, frustrated, leaves. As she walks down the street, a policeman stops her, recognizing her as the fugitive and tries to arrest her, but Spike shows up out of nowhere and knocks him out. After a brief fight, he strikes a deal with her: he will help stop Angelus if she allows him and Drusilla to leave town. Spike explains that while vampires may love to talk about destroying the world amongst themselves, he prefers the world as it is. Moreover, he cannot stand the way Drusilla acts around Angelus. While Buffy is unimpressed by his speech, he reminds her that he is all she has got, and that neither of them can fight both Angelus and Dru alone.

After Buffy finally breaks the silence lingering in the room, Riley tries to figure out who she really is.  When Riley withholds information on his own secret identity, Buffy offers her own description of what he does for a living.  Surprised by Buffy's accuracy, Riley turns the spotlight back on her.  However, Riley is not at all familiar with the name Slayer, so Buffy encourages him to find out on his own.  Just as Riley is about to leave the dorm, they notice some rattling coming from the rat's cage, followed by a sudden earthquake.  Although the quake is relatively brief, it's more than enough to alarm Buffy.

Dawn lays on her bed (more teen love lost music plays) as Buffy confronts Dawn about the outfit. Dawn offers to buy her another one but Buffy says it's not the point, she doesn't want another cheerleading outfit. "Now now, let's not be hasty" Xander says from behind her. Buffy sits on Dawn's bed, trying to console her sister yet again, but Dawn is totally lost in RJ. Xander says it's gotta be the jacket, the big letterman jacket that boys in high school wear, he saw it all the time before. Dawn says strongly that it isn't a crush, it's love. Buffy is still supportive but tries to talk her down, saying it's too soon, too fast, etc. "Maybe I don't want advice from the dysfunction queen" Dawn says coldly to Buffy, claiming that Buffy is making fun of her. Dawn tells her to go (a perfect "Get out get out get OUT!" scene but the line wasn't used thank goodness) as Xander backs out slowly.

The next morning, a slightly manic Buffy blows her chance at the cheerleading squad when she tosses another girl through the room, ceding her slot to none other than Amy. Buffy turns out to have something more than just a mood disorder: a Bloodstone Vengeance Spell has destroyed her immune system, giving her only about three hours to live. The only way to cure her and break the other spells is to get the witch's spell book. The ailing Buffy and Giles go confront Catherine - only to realize that the real Amy is stuck in her mother's middle-aged body, while her mother is reliving her glory days. Giles finds the witch's book and takes Amy and Buffy back to school to break the spells. Buffy is fading fast.

Giles walks with Buffy down a nighttime Sunnydale street. He  questions her on the Christmas tree lot (from Amends) where she saw the First  years ago, but she says it was actually in caves underneath. As they walk, they  pass Christmas lights and decorations, and Buffy comments how she almost forgot  the time of the year, and wonders if they should go home and decorate the  rubble. She wonders if he'll ever come back for a real visit. "If we survive  this, I promise" he says. "Good, 'cause I miss you." She says emotionally. "I  miss you too" he responds.

Afterwards, Buffy goes to Spike's crypt with the intention of staking him; however, when she confronts him, he angrily tells her to kill him.

The basement door opens and we hear the chuckling of SIT's    from above. Faith comes down the stairs alone, frustraited at the noise and    giddyness. She sits on the stair stoop and pulls out a cigarette, lighting it,    tries to relax. "You craving a moment alone in the dank? Can I bum one?"    Spike says from his cot. He half-lays (yes, shirtless) on his cot as Faith smiles    and gives him her cigarette, then lights one for herself. Faith notices the    shackles and chains behind him, which prompts her to hint that she likes it    kinky too, starting to tell a story about her, a schoolgirl costume, and a bullwhip.    Spike says it's not what she thinks, that he got dangerous for a while. The    two talk about his previous "danger" and her incarceration, the "spazzing"    SIT's upstairs, and there is a defininte sexual overtone to everything that    they say. MASSIVE flirting going on. The two also compare their dangers, how    Faith was jailed and, while she could have escaped earlier, chose not to cause    she was repentant. More sexual talk (stuff I'm not gonna leak here, let's just    say Faith was locked up a long time).

The next morning, Buffy hides the puncture wounds left by Dracula's bite with a scarf. Everyone meets at Giles' house to talk about what they have learned. Willow says that Dracula would rather have a connection with his victims than just kill them. His special powers include reading and controlling minds and appearing in dreams. Giles says that Dracula prefers that his victims be somewhat willing, and even yearn for him. This makes Buffy uncomfortable and she tries to leave. Riley confronts her and rips the scarf off. Everyone sees the bite marks left on her exposed neck. She explains that she's not exactly sure how it happened. Riley guesses that she's under the thrall of Dracula and shouldn't go anywhere near him. Xander offers to keep an eye on her at his place. Willow and Tara prepare to do a protection spell on Buffy's house while Giles and Riley search for Dracula. Xander tells Buffy that he has to take her to the master. Buffy willingly agrees.

Willow looks up some info on RJ on her laptop as Xander and Anya sit nearby. "Love spells.. .people forget how dangerous they can be..." Willow says. "Hey, been there." Xander responds and then goes into flashback mode, with scenes of the attacking girls from "Bewitched Betrothed and Bewildered" for a few seconds in his mind. He smiles "ah... good times." Buffy walks in, saying that Dawn has locked her door and that the spell has her all loopy and stuff. Willow says she found some info on RJ, which gets Buffy giddy, asking if there's a picture. Xander reads the laptop, seeing that RJ's brother, a guy who used to pick on Xander in high school, still lives in the area, and even though the relattionship is "complex at best", he thinks it might be a way to RJ to see what's up.

Now Dawn lurks between the stacks of books in the school library, watching Cassie talking to a hunky teen boy at a table. They talk about studying for tests and designing tattoos before she starts doodling in a notebook. The boy then wonders why they shouldn't go to "that dance" after all, but Cassie says she already told him she didn't want to go, that it would be lame.

Buffy wakes up the next morning to see Kathy squirming in her bed, apparently having the same dream. Later, Willow talks to Kathy in the dorm hallway about Buffy. Seeing Buffy approaching, Kathy takes off. Willow then listens in fearful concern as Buffy declares that Kathy is evil and must be killed. Buffy tries to explain that she took a sample of Kathy's toenail clippings and realized that they continued to grow by themselves. However, Willow has already concluded that her friend has gone off the deep end. Willow tells her to talk to Giles, then calls him up to warn him of Buffy's arrival. Buffy enters Giles' apartment and is greeted by a falling net from above. Giles, Xander, and Oz rush out to restrain Buffy with ropes, fearing that her murder plan must be stopped at all costs. Buffy leads Giles to the toenail clippings in her bag and tries to convince them that she's right. However, Giles believes that Buffy has been possessed by the demon she fought in the woods. While Xander and Oz take positions as watch guards over the restrained Slayer, Willow tries to warn Kathy about Buffy's intentions. Kathy's response of Buffy's come-uppance only scares Willow more, and she leaves shortly after getting a call from Oz. Back at the apartment, Buffy frees herself from the ropes and tricks Xander and Oz into coming close enough for her to knock them out.

Buffy and Angel continue the kiss then break off, almost    out of breath. "Well, I guess that qualifies as happy to see me" Angel    smiles. Buffy starts to ask him what he's doing there, but first takes a moment    to "bask", then she asks him. Angel hints that he's heard about the    trouble in Sunnydale as he goes and grabs a book/folder that he placed on a    shelf earlier. Angel asks if it's the First, the same one that tried to convince    him to kill himself. Buffy says yes, but it's gotten more ambitous by trying    to raise an army. Angel starts to say that the First failed once, it will again,    but suddenly he's batted aside, sent sliding across the floor into a stone pillar!    Buffy stands wide eyed, still clutching the Scythe, as she stares at Caleb,    who is bleeding a blackish blood from his eyes and mouth "Are you ready    to finish this... BITCH?!?"

Buffy, in Angel's jacket, later meets him at the Bronze. He tells her to keep it, and Buffy is obviously smitten.

This ghostly episode starts out at The Bronze where Buffy rejects the advances of a boy who's looking for a date for the Sadie Hawkins dance. She tells him she's never going to date anyone again. On her way to check in with Giles, she stops a male student from almost shooting a female student. They have no recollection of why they were fighting, and the gun disappears. Later, Principal Snyder blames Buffy for the incident. While waiting in his office after he gets called out, a yearbook from 1955 mysteriously falls off the shelf. Willow gives Giles a rose quartz necklace that she found in Ms. Calendar's desk after he stops by to check on Willow's new assignment as computer science teacher. In class later that day, Buffy falls asleep and dreams about events that take place in the same classroom, but in 1955: a male student and a female teacher are having an affair, and stand in the classroom clandestinely talking. As Buffy comes back to the present, her teacher writes something from the lesson on the board. As he finishes writing, it becomes clear that he has unintentionally written "Don't walk away from me, bitch!" which is a line uttered by the student holding the gun who Buffy stopped. Afterward, Xander is grabbed by a monster arm inside his locker. Buffy helps him break away, but the arm disappears when they return to look.

Immediately after the First leaves, Willow receives a text message with a help code from Xander. Spike offers to go fetch Buffy. He finds her at the restaurant with Wood in a slightly romantic moment, and they all rush out to rescue Xander, driving in Wood's car, the three of them awkwardly together with Spike in the backseat. When they get to the seal beneath the school, they fight and kill the demon woman and find Xander not too badly hurt. They prevent the seal from opening again, but during the course of the fight, Wood finds out that Spike is a vampire and that Buffy cares about him very much, making him uneasy.

Now the Bringers reappear, but this time the SIT's aren't    quite with it. They are being pummeled easily as Kennedy gets thrown aside into    a barrel and is knocked unconscous. Rona goes to the attack but Caleb grabs    her arm in a submission hold "Miss, I do believe you have your own problems    you should be worried about" he says as he casually breaks her arm. She    crumples to the ground and Caleb smiles as Caleb picks up a Bringer's knife,    tosses it to a Bringer, who then gets ready to stab the fallen Rona. Suddenly    an arrow strikes the Bringer's Arm. Xander stands at the foot of the stairs    with a bow as he, Faith, and another SIT (or two?) charge into the fray. Xander    rushes off to help Buffy while Faith confronts Caleb, who recognizes her as    the second Slayer and compares her to Cain. Some small biblical talk between    the two as Caleb clearly has the upper hand. Faith lays in a few good licks,    but soon she loses and Caleb kicks her hard in the air and into a wine barrel,    which shatters when she hits, drenching her in wine.

Still dreaming, Faith sees Buffy chasing her through a rain drenched cemetery.  When she falls into an open grave, Buffy jumps in after her.  After an unseen battle, Faith alone emerges from the six foot hole.  Back in reality, her eyes explode open as she awakens from her coma.  Disoriented, the groggy Faith rips out her IV and wanders down the barren Coma Ward halls.  She comes across a teenage visitor who she forces to tell the date and explain what happened on Sunnydale High graduation day.  With ambiguous intentions, Faith storms out of the hospital unnoticed by the staff.  Meanwhile, alone in Buffy's dorm room, Riley and the Slayer share a tender moment of affection.  Riley explains that he is afraid to leave the Initiative, no matter how corrupt they may seem.  He feels that without the soldier in him, he's got nothing.  Buffy reassures him that he's much more than just a soldier.  Meanwhile, at the hospital, doctors and FBI agents search the hospital frantically for the missing Faith.  The teenage girl she encountered is found unconscious and badly beaten.  The head nurse makes a secretive phone call to an unknown organization telling them to mobilize a team.

The three SIT's continue to talk as Kennedy    walks in, asking if they're ready? Dawn feels left out as she asks about their    little trip. Vi corrects her, telling her it's an "Outing." Kennedy    is stoked, saying they might get to kill something this trip. Dawn tries to    join the discussion saying she's killed things before, but in walks Buffy with    Andrew following behind, practically begging to go along on the outing. Buffy    tells him no. Andrew thinks it's because they think he's evil. Buffy corrects    him saying he's not evil, but evil latches onto him. Spike walks in and now    that everyone is gathered, they head out, grabbing weapons off the table and    leaving a disheartened Dawn and Andrew behind. "You wanna play Dragonballs-Z?"    Andrew asks a hurt Dawn.

Buffy slowly comes to in an eerily lit cave and finds she    is chained to the floor by shackles on her wrists. The three Shadow men stand    with their staves and tell her that she at the beginning and they have brought    her here. Buffy struggles against the chains as two of the Shadow men start    to rhythmically bang their staves on the ground as the third grabs a box and    places it in the center of an swirled design on the cave floor. He opens the    box as the three men say "Herein lies your strength. The energy of the    demon. It's spirit. It's heart." Straining against the chains, a little    worried, Buffy sees a floating black mass of liquidy-smoke arise from the box,    swirling in the air before her. The two Shadow men continue their staff beat    as the third tells her that she will become one with the power, and it will    make her ready for the fight. They say this is how it was done and how it must    be. Buffy struggles as the black demon-cloud approaches her and starts to enter    inside her nose, mouth, and eyes...

In the minutes after Willow's flaying of Warren, Buffy, Xander and Anya run through the woods. As Xander fights the urge to be sick after what he saw, Buffy deduces by Willow's last words ("one down") mean that she's going after Jonathan and Andrew, who are still in jail. Confused, Xander asks why Willow would now try to kill Jonathan and Andrew since they had nothing to do with killing Tara, but Buffy says that Willow has an addictive personality and once she starts something, she won't stop. Anya then brings up the fact that Willow will take some time to get to the jail, even at her magic level. Using her new demon powers, Anya teleports herself to get there first so she can save the boys. Buffy and Xander then talk about Willow with Buffy saying that now that Willow has killed someone, things change. Xander, however, tries to justify Willow's actions by again reminding Buffy that Warren was a cold-blooded serial killer of women just getting started, and that he finally got what he deserved. Despite this, Buffy still doesn't believe that Warren deserved to die for killing Tara, but she and Xander agree that Jonathan and Andrew definitely don't deserve to die since they never killed anybody. Seconds later, Buffy and Xander find Xander's car destroyed, courtesy of Willow, and Buffy runs ahead by herself, leaving a self-loathing Xander behind to complain.

Buffy learns about working at the Magic Box from Giles and Anya as Jonathan began castinga spell to loop time. Buffy assists a man with a candle sale and then goes downstairs to fetch a live mummy hand for a female customer. The hand attacked her and she was forced to kill it, which also killed the sale. Events started to repeat themselves (a la Groundhog Day ) as Buffy must satisfy the customer while dealing with the mummy hand. If she fails, the events reset to when the customer walks into the store. Buffy becames increasingly agitated, even taking off Giles' glasses and stepping on them in one loop, and crying in another. After several loops, Buffy finally manages to end the spell by promising the customer they'll deliver the mummy hand instead so she doesn't have to deal with it directly. Although Giles congratulates Buffy on making her first sale, Anya reminds her that she didn't charge extra for the item's delivery and (despite GIles trying to ignore the mistake) decides to take the money out of Buffy's pay. This is the last straw for Buffy, and she quits as the three villains keep score.

We finally kind of find out what is behind that mysterious Dawn kid this week.  An unseen evil pays a visit to Sunnydale and ends up helping Buffy discover more about her strange, secretive sibling. Seems Dawn is "The Key" to either great good or great evil, and certain forces out there wouldn't mind getting their paws on the kid in order to use her for their own naughtiness -- including Clare Kramer ("Bring It On"), who joins the cast as a saucy minion from hell, sent to destroy Dawn.  Unfortunately, minions from hell are the least of the Summers family troubles. It looks like Joyce's health woes will continue, distressing the girls and totally confusing them when she falls ill again without any explanation, medical or supernatural. Has moms been taking her vitamins? Hopefully the strange, glowing ball of mystery will reveal the truth soon.  Giles' Magic Shop opened to booming business, doing so well in fact that he's hired Anya to help out around the place.  Finally--it seems that Spike's dreams of love for the Slayer have overflowed into reality. He's taken to hanging out in front of the Summers' house and dare we say, taken to staking out the Slayer.

At his newly acquired magic shop, Giles rummages through a box of miscellaneous charms and trinkets when he is surprised by the demon who was reciting the anti-Slayer incantation the night before.

Later that day, Giles recounts his run-in with the demon to the gang while Willow finds a book on demons.  She discovers that the demon's name is Toth and that he prefers to fight using special devices. Giles mentions that the demon smelled of a distinct odor but couldn't guess exactly what it was. Buffy, Riley, Willow, Xander and Giles decide to go looking for him somewhere chock-full of odors - the city dump.  When they get there, they bump into Spike, who is scavenging for lovely items for the home.  When they inquire about the demon, Spike informs them that he sees one right behind them.  As the gang turns around to look for themselves, Toth points a rod-like device at them and fires a destructive blast, which misses.  He shoots again and Xander dives in front of Buffy, taking the full brunt of the blast. They rush mistakenly over to an imposter Xander, created by the blast, who lies in a pile of trash, and are relieved to find that he is not seriously hurt.  After they help him to his feet, they discover that the demon has vanished.

Given her prior arrangements, Buffy assigns Giles and Xander to patrol duty. At the end of psych class, Willow points out to Riley that he didn't call out Oz's name while taking attendance. Riley explains that Oz dropped the course and won't be coming back. When Willow tries to convince him otherwise, Professor Walsh makes it clear that Oz is gone from the class for good. Buffy overhears this and gives the professor a piece of her mind before taking off after Willow. Later, Riley tells Forrest and Graham about Buffy's confrontation with Walsh. When Parker passes by, Forrest tries to get some details on Buffy. Parker's chauvinistic attitude results in a punch to the face from Riley's fist. Outside, Riley comes to the realization that he really likes Buffy. Seeking out Willow at her dorm, Riley asks Buffy's roommate for some helpful advice. In light of her recent heartbreak, Willow is not too keen on helping Riley hook up with Buffy, but she eventually decides to give him the benefit of the doubt.

The Ubervamp looks around and growls, hitting a stack of pipes and sending the pipes scattering as a show of force. "oh no no no no no..." mutters one of the SIT's (the non-hat one who is now named Chloe I think). They all stand in a bunch, weapons drawn tentatively, not ready for what's to come, when suddenly the area is flooded with light! Huge worklights brighten up the entire area and the SIT's look around, finally noticing the imposing form of Buffy, standing on a ledge, sillouetted by light. Seeing that Ubie is distracted, Kennedy draws her crossbow up and is ready to fire, but Willow pushes it back down "Just watch... it's showtime..." They all back up and begin to climb the scaffolds to safety as Buffy looks on, throwing jibes at the Ubervamp. She jumps, doing a forward summersault and approaches the Ubervamp with confidence, saying that up until then, he's done his job, letting the SIT's just sit around and wait to be killed, but now it's her turn and she's gonna kick his ass, yada yada. (it's a nice speech, trust me, but too lengthy to put down now). "Welcome to Thunderdome" she ends with, as Andrew mumbles "Two men enter, one man leaves..."

Buffy and Xander walk down the basement corridor and hear Spike's murmuring in the distance. They approach him as he rambles on about someone not being finished. Buffy gets his attention. "You went away..." he says to her, then rambles about a body, asking if there is blood? Buffy and Xander see that he knows something and they ask him for help. Spike gets a warm look on his face and approaches Buffy slowly, saying "look at you, glowing..." Spike gets flustered, saying he should go away. "Everyone is talking to me, but no one is talking to each other." He looks away, then at Buffy and Xander, who decide Spike is not of use and start to walk out. More rambling: "Someone isn't here...Button button, who's got the button? My money is on the Witch..." THAT line stops Buffy and Xander in their tracks. They question him again, wondering if he's seen Willow. Spike talks of a body and skin, saying that "they think you did it." He then excuses himself, saying he has to leave. I have to go. There are things here without permission. I have to check their slips..."

Not the Bang, not the Word, the true beginning. and the next few months are going to be quite a riot, and I think we're all going to learn something about ourselves in the process. You'll learn you're a pathetic smuck, if it hasn't sunk in already... Look at you, trying to do what's right, just like her. You still don't get it.. it's not about right... it's not about wrong..."
|
"Get these sodding things off me, I'm FINE!" Spike    argues to the group that he's still chained to the wall, but Buffy wants him    to wait until he's sure. He says the stone is out and it probably did it's job,    but Giles says that the stone was only a catalyst, not the cure. Spike does    remember the name of the song, Early One Morning, and says it was a    song that his mother used to sing him.

Once she realizes who Spike is, Faith speaks to him seductively and teases him ruthlessly, telling him all the things she could do to his body; when it is obvious that Spike is confused, yet attracted to her, she concludes by telling him that she won't do anything she could do to Spike "... because it's wrong." Frustrated and furious, Spike promises that as soon as he gets his chip out, they will have a confrontation. Faith, however, merely smirks at Spike's threat and walks away from him, and he storms out of The Bronze soon after.

He's surprised to find her on top of R.J. and promptly takes her home for a much needed intervention with the others.

Buffy tells the rest of the gang the truth about her little sister while Dawn figures out for herself  through a little late night breakin to the Magic Shop and Giles' notes  that she is "The Key." It couldn't come at a more unfortunate time. The bad luck Buffy birthdays continue. The gang gears up to celebrate the Slayer's big 2-0 and find they must once again break up the celebration, this time in order to find a very traumatized teen. Dawn is not taking the whole "Key" news very well, feeling she's not even real. The crazy, cutting-arm-with-kitchen-knife scene was not to be missed. Dawn wanted to see if her blood was real. She also feels the only reason the Slayer's looking after her is because she's part of the "job". So, after some bedroom tantrum time and a little book burning, Dawn takes off into the night in an attempt to find answers. It's going to be up to the Scoobies to find the runaway before Glorificus and her minions get their paws on her. While they search the town, Dawn ends up at the hospital.

Spike is snapped back by the leather restraints. All a dream. The First-Buffy (in a different outfit) looks at him with a sneer, taunting him by seeing that he's thinking about "her" again. The First talks coldly, saying that Spike should just give it up because they can't win. She looks behind her at the Uber-Vamp, who snarls in agreement and heads off somewhere. The First starts to continue the disheartening talk when she notices Spike is muttering to himself. She pulls in closer to hear. "She... will come for me." He mutters in a half-aware state. "no, I won't" says the First-Buffy, smiling sarcastically.

Buffy enters the room again and ask Spike if he's better.  Spike says yes, and then comments that he doesn't remember anything. Buffy  chalks it up to withdrawl, but Spike says not that, he means all the deaths he's  caused. He admits he's been out of it, losing time a lot, waking up in strange  places. Buffy asks when his chip stopped working. "I wasn't aware that it had,  you know... not till now." he answers. He says things have been wonky for him  ever since he got back his soul. Buffy then asks him how he got his soul back.  "Saw a man about a girl" he starts out. He tells that he went across the world  to make a deal with a demon, with a price (the trials). He then says it was  tough, but he's found other things just as worse. Buffy asks what he means.  "Meaning i've come to redefine the terms pain and suffering ever since I fell in  love with you." Buffy looks at him in shock, wondering how he could say that,  but he says he just killed a bunch of people, being polite isn't really  important anymore. She now thinks she knows what it's about, him feeling sorry  for himself, "I'm feeling honest with myself. you used me. you told me that of  course. I never understood it of course, not until now. You hated yourself, and  you took it out on me."

Meanwhile, Buffy and the gang arrive at Giles' apartment and find it totaled.  The torn clothes on the floor lead them to believe that Giles may have been seriously harmed.  Riley arrives in response to a series of 911 calls that reported the sighting of a large demon in the neighborhood.  When they find a passage in Giles' books about the Fyarl demon that matches Xander's description, Buffy deduces the possibility that the mystical force that Willow felt was caused by a spell being performed to gain control of this Fyarl demon.  Following the book's information that the Fyarl demon is vulnerable to silver, Buffy grabs a letter opener on the way out.  Along with Riley, she breaks into the magic shop and discovers that Ethan has been there recently.  When Riley orders a search on Ethan's location, they track him down to the motel.

"But you just let him go." Anya argues with Spike    in the basement as Buffy and Wood come down the stairs and observe. Anya wants    to know why Spike didn't fight him, but Spike logically says that if he fought    and the demon got lucky, he'd get knocked out and then it would go and kill    her. Rational Spike is showing his self, saying that Anya's safest place was    with him, out of danger. Anya knows he's right but she barges off anyways, past    Wood and Buffy and up the stairs. "no need to thank me, I'm just the one    who beat him off!" Spike calls after her, and after an embarrassing glance    from Buffy, he continues "Repelled him perhaps should have been the better    phrase."

Out of the room, Buffy calls out to the "dead guys", and wonders where they went. She tries to reason it out, and then remember's the comment about the Talisman. She jumps on her cell phone again. "Xander..."

Pleased to wake up next to Riley in the morning, Buffy revels in her newfound happiness.  When Buffy asks Riley if he knows anything about 314, the ringing of the telephone immediately breaks up their moment.  Reporting in for duty, Riley stops outside the restricted-access security door.  Curious about what Buffy said, he peers through the window and sees another door with the same number inscribed on it.  Interrupting Riley's investigation, Maggie orders him to lead the Beta team in recapturing Spike.  Once Riley leaves, Maggie informs Dr. Angleman that Buffy is apparently aware of their secret experiment.  While Maggie prepares their back-up plan, Dr. Angleman completes the amputation of the Polgara demon's left arm.  On the surface, Spike retreats to Giles' apartment for help.  When Xander identifies the object in Spike's back as a tracking device, they conclude that the Initiative will be on their doorstep in no time.  Meanwhile, Buffy returns to her room and finds that Willow's bed hasn't been slept in.  Willow arrives shortly, but another series of beeps from Buffy's pager prevents the two from going into any detail regarding the events of the previous night.  After Buffy takes off, Willow gets a call from Giles, who requests her assistance.  At the apartment, Willow recites a spell that ionizes the surrounding atmosphere, thus obscuring the tracer's signal.  As soon as Giles successfully removes the tracking device, Xander flushes it down the toilet, bringing an abrupt end to Beta team's mission.

The vampires from the nest surround a distraught Buffy as she's leaving the shop. She stakes all eight of them in record time, including the vampire who had been seen drinking from Riley. Xander witnesses the slaying and confronts Buffy, telling her he thinks that Riley has given her everything, and risked everything for her, and accuses her of treating Riley as a rebound guy and of expecting him to be 'convenient' after Angel's departure from Sunnydale. She points out that Xander himself treats Anya as a mere convenience, but Xander pursues his point, telling her that her relationship with Riley is the kind that comes around once in a lifetime, and that she has to decide if she's really willing to lose him for good.

Buffy is at work, cleaning the grill with a coworker, Todd, who talks non-stop and then leaves Buffy to finish cleaning alone. On the way home from work, Buffy runs into a vampire, but once the vampire finds out that Buffy was working at Doublemeat Palace and smells like it, he tries to escape and instead is staked by an offended Slayer. Finally home, Buffy finds Spike waiting in front of her house. She knows what he's there for, but with Dawn waiting inside, she refuses to let him follow her into the house. Instead, he persuades her to stay outside with him and they drop to the grass together.
|
Back at the house, Spike tells Buffy that as the First has revealed to have plans for him, that might endanger others, he will leave town. Buffy tells Spike not to leave because she isn't ready for him not to be there. In the final scene of the episode, the First shows itself to Wood in the guise of his dead mother  and, though it does not say so explicitly, leads him to conclude that it was Spike who killed her.

In London, Giles bursts into the home of the dead girl, and finds the other man stabbed. The man's eyes fly open. "It's started," he gurgles, just as a ghoulish robed figure swings an axe at Giles' head. Hello, cliffhanger.

Later that night, Buffy senses a mysterious presence somewhere outside of the dorm, but she can't place her finger on what it is. Unbeknownst to Buffy, Angel has arrived in Sunnydale to follow up on a foreshadowing vision that his partner had. Knowing only that Buffy will encounter some great danger in the near future, Angel stands hidden in the bushes outside of Stevenson Hall, staring up at the window of his former love's room.  Turning back to her roommate, Buffy decides that they should have their own Thanksgiving celebration, seeing how Joyce is out of town for the holidays. Although she is opposed to the genocidal history of Thanksgiving, Willow agrees to the plans for her friend's sake. Buffy then decides to hold the dinner at Giles' home.

"The Vampire is an animal... sometimes they run in    packs, sometimes they run alone" Buffy begins her "class" to    the SIT's by showing them a dark, dingy, dank cript by flashlight. They look    around, disgusted, and even Spike comments that the place is lacking in style.    Buffy brings up that vampires can live anywhere, but the animal inside is always    the same. Molly asks where Spike lived. He tells them he lived in a crypt but    it was much more posh. "comfy" chimes in Buffy, which Kennedy questions.    "Moving on..." Buffy continues, she tells them to split up and look    around the place, looking for clues that vampires might have been there. After    a few moments, Rona and Molly say they've found a body. Upon investigating and    checking the face down body, Buffy says it's not a body, it's leftovers. As    she rises from a crowch, the "body" slowly rises also, snarling in    Vamp face.
|
Instead of sleeping, we find Molly in the living room telling other Slayers-In-Training about Annabell, who always seemed the level-headed one before she paniced and got taken out by the Turok-Han. The three SIT's, all new and not seen before, listen to it as if it's a ghost story. They then all get worried looks on their faces as one of them mentiones that Buffy has been gone a long time. From a couch, Xander interrupts "Maybe potential slayers can go without sleep. Me, I'm no good unless I've had my usual 90 minutes." "I'm with him, keep the chatter down!... or speak up so I can hear you better. I'm bored, episode One bored..." pipes up Andrew, STILL tied to a chair and set apart from the rest of the group. In the front door walks Buffy and Rona and introductions are made with everyone saying "Hi Rona." "Um, why is that guy tied to a chair?" is Rona's first question. "The question you'll soon be asking is why isn't he gagged?" Xander answers. Giles and Anya walk in from the kitchen, Anya prepping another sleeping bag. Giles suggests Molly take Rona for something to eat and the two head towards the kitchen. Buffy mentions to the group that Rona had Bringers waiting and then says she needs a way to kill the First. Giles says after some research he did, they still have very little to go on. Anya says the same, saying she did the rounds in the demon community and came up with nothing. Buffy then asks for any info on the Turok-Han. "Any idea what can kill it... Sunlight? Fire? Germs?" Andrew interrupts, trying to insert himself into the conversation by asking how Buffy will get to Spike with the Turok-Han guarding him? Buffy wants to shut Andrew up, but says he's got a point. Eve (long blonde haired SIT) questions about Spike, asking if he's the vampire that was killing recently. Buffy starts to explain, but then gives up, saying it's complicated. The three new SIT's (I'm not gonna describe the other two until they're given names, so there. :P ) say that they've been talking and are wondering if there's any sort of plan. Buffy sighs and says simply that they're working on it. Giles interrupts, saying there is an avenue they haven't tried yet: Beljox's eye, a sort of oracle in a different dimension. Anya is somewhat disturbed by the suggestion, but Buffy says they have to know soon, as Spike is running short on time.

As Snyder overhears the Scoobies making fun of Giles, he punishes them by forcing them to participate in the talent show making it clear that he's far different from Mr. Flutie in that he's not interested in making friends with his students but making them suffer. The next try-out is Morgan and his dummy, Sid, and Buffy confesses to being freaked out by dummies. Morgan's act takes a sudden turn for the better when Sid suddenly develops a personality and starts making sarcastic comments about the act. Emily notices the demon and screams.

Buffy regains consciousness inside a prison cell. Lily, who's sitting inside the same cell, believes they're in Hell. Buffy denies this, but that becomes irrelevant as Ken explains their situation. Apparently, they are in some alternate dimension outside of Earth, and time passes differently here. According to Ken, one day on Earth equals one hundred years in this dimension. Buffy puts the pieces together and realizes that the disoriented old people she saw on the street must have been former slaves in this dimension, including Rickie. Buffy, Lily, and several other runaways are then led into a room. A demon guard tells them that they no longer have any individual identities. He then asks a boy to identify himself. When the boy responds with his own name, the guard beats him with a club. Lily's next, and her answer is "no one". A few more slaves respond in the same manner. The guard then asks Buffy. Instead of giving the expected answer, Buffy finally comes to terms with who she is and responds with her true identity, that of the Slayer. With that, Buffy proceeds to fight and subdue the guards in the room. After telling Lily to lead the others to the exit, Buffy runs out into the middle of the factory and battles an endless number of demon guards. One after the other, Buffy defeats them, until Ken grabs Lily and threatens to slice her throat with a knife for Buffy's disobedience. Surprisingly, Lily pushes Ken off the balcony while his back is turned, enabling Buffy to fight off the guards holding her and climb to safety. At the exit, they encounter a heavy gate which Buffy uses all of her strength to lift. Just as she's about to escape herself, Ken tackles her. As he does so, Buffy is knocked towards the outside of the gate, which comes crashing down on Ken's legs. Buffy then takes Ken's club and smashes it onto his skull. After Buffy, Lily, and the other runaways climb through the black pool, it seals itself.

Buffy realizes that the warehouse is a vampire nest, and thus they couldn't have been involved in the train massacre.

At first, Spike loudly denies it, but then asks, in a hopeful manner, "Do you want it to be?" Buffy is immediately disgusted.

Buffy is beeped by the Initiative and is sent on a new mission - to find a class 3 (not very dangerous) creature and transmit a picture of it to Maggie Walsh. She is told it will be an easy mission. Wearing a microphone and camera, complete with a heart monitor, Buffy goes on the mission alone, but it turns out to be a trap set by Professor Walsh. Instead of being a small and non-dangerous demon, it turns out to be two very large demons who are both armed, and who Buffy had previously seen imprisoned at the Initiative. Steel doors slam shut, trapping Buffy in a small area of the sewers with the demons. She attempts to use the Initiative weapon that Professor Walsh gave her, but it is defective and doesn't work. Meanwhile, Riley is kept out of the way by being sent out with a team to find and recover Hostile 17.

Now walking in the basement of Sunnydale High, Andrew leads  Xander, Buffy, and Dawn to the seal. He apparently got them lost a few times,  but they finally find it. "Look at the goat heady badness" comments Xander upon  seeing it. Buffy asks what it does, but Andrew says he doesn't know, it didn't  work because there wasn't enough blood. Dawn sees the toucher wheel off on the  side and comments how there's lots of blood on it. "Looks like the first made  another sacrifice, or a music video..." Buffy thinks that what Spike was taken  for. Andrew starts to get nervous, saying the wheel wasn't there before and he  had nothing to do with it. Xander gets in his face "Thanks for clearing that up.  'Cause otherwise we might have thought you were up to no good here at the  satanic manhole cover. YOU KILLED YOUR BEST FRIEND!" Andrew says Johnathan told  him he was in a place of joy and peace, but Xander corrects him, saying he got  tricked by a fake ghost. Buffy shuts the two up and hands them shovels, saying  they can't leave the seal exposed, it's too dangerous. All four start to work on  burying the seal.

The next morning, Giles gives Jenny's book to Buffy and points out the revoking spell that he just found. Buffy and Willow first help Cordy perform the steps on her car. The three of them then perform the spell in Willow's house. While there, Cordy notices a piece of paper left on Willow's bed. Willow unfolds it, then hands it to Buffy. It is a sketch of Joyce, asleep and completely unaware of Angel's presence. Buffy and Willow race to her house to perform the spell. Joyce soon pulls into the driveway, where Angel waits for her to get out of the car. Angel pleads with Joyce to help him get Buffy back, and he eventually mentions the night they made love. Joyce finally unlocks the front door and enters the house. Angel tries to follow her in, but a force holds him back. He then sees Buffy and Willow coming down the steps, and the door is promptly slammed in front of him. Back in Jenny's classroom, Giles walks in. She tells him that she may have some good news, so Giles invites her to stop by his house later. Meanwhile, Drusilla visits the shopkeeper after hours and asks him what he's been up to with Jenny Calendar.

On the other side of the portal, Buffy is back in the desert where she once met the First Slayer. There, three African shamans speaking Swahili, tell her she is the last slayer to guard the Hellmouth and try to infuse her with additional essence of the demon that give all the slayers their strength. Buffy refuses the power, telling the men that they were wrong to have created the slayer line in the first place. As a parting gift, one of them touches Buffy's head and gives her a vision .

After lamenting that Buffy should have killed the vampire, Giles walks from the crypt to The Bronze, where he meets Anya getting applause and laughs as a stand-up comedian and Xander (with a bloody chest wound) and Willow, who warn him of their attacker. They are busy researching in old books, and they ask Giles to help them, impressing upon him the importance of getting the right answer or "we don't stand a chance." Giles breaks out into song, as he has realized that "the spell we cast with Buffy must have released some primal evil," and gives Willow and Xander orders on how to deal with what hunts them, but when the sound system breaks down, he crawls backstage, following a cable. He begins to realize who his pursuer is, as the girl jumps on top of him. Giles tells her that he can defeat her with his intellect, but she'd never understand as she "never had a Watcher". The girl thenscalps him.

At the Bronze, Buffy and Willow notice Oz's focused attention on Veruca's performance. Buffy tries to help Willow out by feigning interest, but Xander and Giles offer no such support. The next morning, Willow wakes up beside Oz and tells him that she's planning to attend a three-day orientation for a local Wicca group. Since these are the same three days for Oz's monthly werewolf transformations, Willow is reluctant to go. Oz insists that she go, for he can take care of himself for the next few days. After psych class, Willow heads to the cafe to meet Oz, whom she finds talking to Veruca at one of the tables. She tries to join the conversation, but Oz and Veruca's music chat leaves Willow out in left field. Sensing some discomfort, Oz leaves abruptly, and Veruca does the same shortly. Buffy finds Willow sitting at the table alone and pulls up a chair. Willow expresses her concern over Oz's apparent interest in Veruca, but Buffy assures her friend that Oz would never destroy their relationship.

However, Willow doesn't leave quicklyy enough and Angelus grabs her by the neck, ready to kill her.

The Scoobies check out the city dump in search of the demon and find Spike collecting. The demon hits Xander with light from a rod and knocks him to the ground. He gets to his feet and walks off with the rest of the gang, but there is another Xander still lying in a pile of trash.

Xander mopes at The Bronze and runs into Spike. As Xander seethes hostility at his presence, Spike fishes for information on Buffy, to no avail. The two eventually begin to play pool and talk about women trouble. Back at the Magic Box, Buffy and Tara fear the worst as they view the destruction left by the troll, and take off to try to track it. The troll arrives at The Bronze, declaring his desire to drink ale and eat babies. Xander suggests that Spike fights the troll, but Spike is "paralyzed by not caring very much." The troll asks Spike and Xander where to find babies to eat. Spike suggests the troll try the hospital, and Xander ineffectually attempts to talk sense into the troll, suggesting that he sit down in one of sturdier chairs to have a calm talk. However, the troll is unsatisfied with their suggestions of stags, strong grog, and onion blossoms. While the troll drinks beer straight from a keg, the rest of the gang gathers at The Bronze. When Buffy arrives, Spike cautiously greets her, but she ignores him and he steps back, his face filled with disappointment.

"Faith still has my room" Buffy says, hinting    to Spike, but he gets upset, saying that she can't stay with him. He can't be    bought off with shiny beads and sweetness. He's not gonna be treated like that.    Buffy is hurt, says she understands, and turns to leave. "Clearly you don't,    cause the whole having my pride thing was just a smokescreen!" Spike says,    darting in front of Buffy, cutting off her retreat. "I dunno what I would    have done if you'd have gone up those stairs..." Spike smiles, and Buffy    smiles back and caresses his cheek.

Returning home, Buffy brings some supper for Angel, who has waited out the day in her room. Awkwardly attempting small-talk, Buffy asks Angel how he passed the time. Unobtrusively setting aside the food, Angel replies that he did "a little reading," a lot of thinking. Buffy notices her diary askew and, suddenly very agitated, begins to explain away entries that reveal her crush on Angel. Clearly amused, but also somewhat at a loss, Angel stops her and explains in turn that Buffy's mother moved the diary while straightening up; Angel swears he didn't read it. As Buffy takes a moment to deal with her embarrassment, Angel returns to his own agenda and confesses that he doesn't think he should be around her. Completely forgetting the diary incident, Buffy tries to deal with this new shock until it finally registers that Angel has also confessed that all he wants to do is to kiss her. Shocked again, Buffy barely listens as Angel continues to mutter miserably that he's older than she is and that he should go.

Still upset about what happened between her and Angel during her visit to Los Angeles , Buffy returns from L.A. to her empty dorm room. Xander brings Riley some clothes, and they talk about their mutual distaste for Angel, Riley having been told by Buffy about her previous relationship with him. However, it emerges that she has not told him the whole truth; while Riley was aware that Angel lost his soul and became Angelus, Xander tells Riley that having sex with Buffy was the trigger that set Angelus free.

At the Magic Box, Willow examines the Buffybot and determines that she'd easily be able to fix it, but sheepishly says she won't after getting a look from Buffy. Giles and Xander return, having dumped Spike back at his crypt. They report that they have been unable to get any hard information out of Spike as to whether or not he exposed Dawn, largely because he was severely beaten and barely conscious. Though disgusted by the Buffybot, Xander feels a bit of sympathy for him because he lost his favorite toy, but also points out the fact that Spike got a severe thrashing. This makes Buffy thoughtful.

Willow investigates Cassie on the computer, and finds Cassie's website filled with sad, morbid poetry. Though Buffy is convinced that Cassie has a precognitive ability and given up hope for survival, Xander and Willow are both skeptical despite their experience with the paranormal. Dawn returns home from school and thinks the reason for Cassie's problem is Mike, but Buffy and the others don't pay much attention. Willow finds a website on Cassie's father that shows his troubled past with the law and alcohol. Buffy and Xander visit Cassie's father and confront him with their suspicion that he may get drunk and hurt his daughter. Mr. Newton confidently denies the accusation after he goes on about how his ex-wife only allows him to spend one weekend a month with his daughter. Buffy then finds out that Mr. Newton's weekend with Cassie was the previous one, therefore not only does he not have the chance to hurt Cassie but if Cassie's prediction is true then he will not see her again before her death. Satisfied that Mr. Newton is not involved, Buffy and Xander leave and bump into Cassie. She had been waiting for them outside of her father's house, and although she appreciates Buffy's efforts to find the cause, she knows there's nothing Buffy can do. Xander asks her if she's planning to kill herself, but Cassie denies it. She talks about all the things she wishes she could do and makes it clear that she doesn't want to die; it's just what is going to happen on Friday.

We see a pencil cup with pencils inside (duh) and as the camera pulls back, we see that cup balanced on Buffy's forehead. She is sitting at her office desk being... busy... when the phone rings, sending the pencils and cup to the ground. She answers the phone. Willow's on the other end and from the Buffy sidded conversation we understand that Willow tells Buffy about the spider demon, the carnage at the frat house, and the ripped out hearts. Buffy takes notes on a pad of paper as she says she'll grab Xander to go along. She is slighly horrified by what Willow described before her mood instantly changes "Hey, did you get that physics class you wanted?"

The Scooby gang meets up at the hospital, and all exchange words of love and friendship towards Buffy, Dawn and each other. Doctor Kriegel tells Buffy that Joyce's autopsy has revealed that she died of an aneurysm resulting from her brain surgery and assures her that Joyce will have died quickly and with almost no pain and that even if she'd been by Joyce's side there would have been little she could have done. Buffy, however, thinks that he's lying to make her feel better, but doesn't say anything. Giles leaves to sign the release forms while Xander, Anya and Willow speak with Buffy while Dawn goes to the ladies' room. They discuss how Dawn is doing, and Buffy feels that Dawn is angry with her for being the one to break the news. Anya then blurts out that she wishes Joyce didn't die in her usual direct manner, but Buffy takes the comment as it was meant and thanks her. The three then decide to go and buy food from the vending machines for the two sisters, leaving Buffy and Tara to sit in awkward silence in the waiting room. Buffy explains that everyone is trying to help, while she still can't believe it's happening. Tara then reveals that her own mother had died when she was seventeen, and shares some helpful words for Buffy on the subject. When Buffy asks Tara if her mother's death was sudden like Joyce's, Tara tells her it wasn't and yet it was.

In the hall, Buffy helps the three re-group, reassuring them that they'll be ok if they stick together. Kit hugs Buffy, and the boy says that Buffy is the coolest mom ever, to which Dawn uneasily kisses Buffy's cheek and heads off with the two other teens. Buffy primps her hair uneasily at the mom quip as Principal Wood walks up, thinking it very curious that Buffy has been talking to "Carlos" and "Kit", two known troublemakers who's files are almost as thick as Buffy's. Principal Wood saw how Buffy handled them, though, and likes that she got them not only socializing, but on their way to class! He then wonders if Buffy wouldn't mind sticking around the school more. She questions what he means, and he points out that there's money in the school buget (though not much) to pay to have someone stick around a hours during the week. She asks if she's being hired as a councellor, but the Principal says no, not a councellor, but instead "someone closer to their age who they can relate to." "I'm in." Buffy says without a second thought. Principal Wood comments again that the pay is not good, but Buffy smiles and says her schedule isn't hot either.

"No eyes... look at him go! They got sonar or something?"    Faith asks Buffy as they walk through a forest, trailing after a Bringer in    the shadows. Faith asks how they appear out of nowhere. Buffy says they're usually    not like this one, which makes Faith think that it is a trap. Buffy starts to    argue that she's tired of waiting around, but Faith stops her, saying she's    with her, ready for some action. They talk lightly about the SIT's and how while    not ready, they are learning and know how to fight. Faith is trying to make    light of the situation but then Buffy bluntly interrupts "Why did you come    back?" Faith is thrown by this and says it wasn't exactly planned, then    she asks Buffy if she doesn't want her here.

Sitting at her work's desk, Buffy talks with Xander on the    phone, telling him he's got to be more careful taking a shower in a house full    of curious teen girls. She notices a girl, Amanda, approach and waves her over.    (Amanda was first seen in "Help" as one of Buffy's first students-to-be-helped.)    Before hanging up, Buffy asks if Giles has checked in from picking up another    SIT, but he apparently hasn't. Amanda sits and opens up with "Do people    ever think you're weird?" She continues to talk about the classic "guys    picking on girls to flirt with them" stuff associated with teens, and how    she'd like to "pick on him" also. Buffy starts to tell her it's ok,    it's normal, but soon her talk dovetails into subliminal talk about mortal enemies    getting along and how that can lead to no good (hinting at her relationship    with Spike). Amanda looks at a now embarassed Buffy, looking even more confused.

Meanwhile, the Scoobies are discussing the situation at the Magic Box when they receive a visit from Spike. He is forcibly removed.

Caleb poors a glass of red wine out from the spiggot of    a winebarrel as he addresses someone about how he always wondered what would    have happened if someone had ordered white wine at the Last Supper. He then    muses that he seemed lost, going from parish to parish, looking for the lord    in all the wrong places. "Then you showed me the light" he says, addressing    a shadow in the corner of the dark wine cellar where he is. "Do you think    I'm god?" Buffy's voice asks as Buffy/the First strolls out of the shadows    calmly. Caleb says he doesn't, that he is beyond such concepts. The First notes    that he still wears "the outfit" (the preacher's suit). Caleb says    he can't turn his back on where he comes from. The First then asks seductively    how he likes what she's wearing, doing a little model twirl for him. "Just    another dirty girl, and since you only dress up as dead folk, I'm guessing one    who has already payed her way." The First asks him to look hard, tell what    he sees. Caleb looks at the First's Slayer form and then notes that he sees    strength, and the lonelyness that comes with that strength. Then it dawns on    him that he is looking at "her." "The Slayer" the First    whispers. Caleb is awestruck, looking at the First's form as if it was a god.    He reaches out and his hand passes through her easily. "All this time,    all the work I've done for you. Blowing up the Councel, organizing the Ray Charles    brigade, and sticking all them splits. You've never shown me." He is still    in awe as Buffy/the First says that he'll get to see the real thing very soon.    Caleb agrees that she'll get the message. The First asks him why she'll come.    Caleb says she won't be able to resist, like offering her an apple.

The coroner takes Tara's dead body away and Xander sees them out. When Xander and Buffy begin to talk about Willow, an angry Dawn jumps in with her view that Warren should be killed, and Xander quickly sides with Dawn, telling Buffy that Warren is "just as bad as any vampire you've sent to dustville". Buffy is clearly disturbed by this and doesn't think it's acceptable for Warren to be killed just because he killed Tara. The way Buffy sees it, Warren is just a normal human and that it's wrong for a Slayer or anyone to kill a human regardless of the bad deeds he's done, even though she knows that the justice system does not always work. Concerned for her friend, Buffy wants this crisis to end without Willow destroying herself, and promises them that Warren will get what he deserves. Though they still stick to their views that Warren is too evil to live, Xander and Dawn agree with Buffy that they must find Willow and bring her home. Buffy refuses to allow Dawn to tag along, and Dawn asks to stay with Spike. Xander immediately gets upset by Buffy's willingness to let that happen and reminds her of Spike's attempted rape the night before, but she's confident Spike can't hurt Dawn and he is their only option. In Tara's dorm room, Willow uses her shirt, splattered with Tara's blood, and magic to create a map to guide the way to Warren.

He asks her if she believes the traffic jam. Buffy says something about the craziness. She asks Clem what he's up to. He says he's getting out of town. Things are going bad in town. This time the bad thing in town feels more powerful than before. He doesn't think anyone can stop it. Then he changes his opinion and says she can stop it, he's sure she can. He rambles for awhile, trying to take his foot out of his mouth, then he tells her maybe she should get out of town this time. Buffy agrees that maybe she should. Clem tells her to take care of herself. She says she will. They wave, the traffic starts to move and Clem drives away.

Buffy runs into Spike in the basement, and the two have an awkward conversation in which Buffy thinks Spike is trying to get her into bed, but then he clarifies that he wants to go patrolling with her that night, notwithstanding the fact that supernatural forces typically don't operate on Halloween. The gang, who have been helping out all day, are worn out. Anya dances with Dawn as she counts her money. Xander looks at her, and decides that the time has finally arrived to announce that he and Anya are engaged. The gang wishes the couple well but privately share their concerns with each other. As Anya gushes about wedding plans and being married, Xander starts to look uncomfortable.

"I swear I'm in awe of you" says Halfrek as the camera pans across an ornate dinner table in St. Petersburg, 1905. The bodies of men sit at each of the settings, slumped in their food, with Anyanka and Halfrek sitting at the head, commenting on Anya's handiwork. They then wonder what they both should do, and Halfrek suggests going and watching the winter mansion get razed, but Anya wants to go to Madam Dubisov's. "No better spot for vengence than a Brothel." Halfrek calmly sips wine and comments that Anya is always work work work (while in the background a well dressed man walks in, his legs on fire, the flames growing as he tries in vane to pat them out. He runs out, engulfed in fire). Haflrek hints that they should stop and take a breather, take a look around at the revolution that Anya is somewhat responsible for, and not work, but after Anya explains (in a very detailed, technical sounding speech) that the Communist revolution was going to happen anyways due to the current political climate, she'd rather get back to work. Halfrek says there are other things and they should relax a tad. "Vengence is what I do, Halfrek... I don' t need anything else." Anya answers.

"Somewhere in Mexico, 2002" reads the caption    as we see a small, run-down shack. Andrew and Johnathan are sleeping together    in a bed, bundled up in blankets. Both of them start having the same nightmarish    dream, with chanting over a scene showing flashes of the Bringers, the Seal    of Dazithar, the Ubervamp, the SIT's getting killed (and a split second shot    of the Cheeseman!), and ending with the seal opening. They both bolt upright,    stricken with terror at their dream, asking if they each had it again. Andrew    also comments that "that voice" was speaking again, saying "Desme    abdo Tay Deborah". They don't know what it means, but they'll look it up    in the Dictonario later. Andrew and Johnathan do a "hunted men" rant,    with Johnathan saying he wasn't even that evil.

She is surprised to hear a totally different sound coming from Riley's heart. Another doctor checks Riley out and recommends that he stay in the hospital after finding that he has an excessively rapid heartbeat. Riley refuses, which worries Buffy. He claims that his heart works differently and that everything is fine. Buffy reminds him that he is still human therefore still capable of having a heart attack.

Several moments later, Oz and Cordelia step out of the closet and notice that all of the zombies are now upstairs.  They run into Giles, who has just arrived.  He explains that the mask contains the power of the zombie demon named Ovu Mobani, or Evil Eye.  All the zombies are after it, and whoever puts it on will become the demon.  Upstairs, nobody notices Pat as she suddenly gets up.  Surprised to see that her friend is alive, Joyce runs over, only to be knocked to the floor by the zombie Pat.  As Joyce and Xander look on, Pat puts the mask on, which immediately molds to her face. Pat begins to speak, except it isn't her voice anymore.  It is the voice of the demon Ovu Mobani, and the zombies that were previously trying to get into the room are now paralyzed with fear by Mobani's presence.  Buffy tries to attack the demon, but it turns its head and flashes a brilliantly white light which stuns Buffy.  Unable to move, Buffy takes the powerful blow of the demon hard.

It cries out in horror, then vanishes, along with all of the other zombies.  After everybody regroups inside, nobody can bring themselves to spite Buffy any longer, as she finally embraces Willow after so long.

Dawn says what's on their minds, but Buffy says if Willow wants help, they're there for her. It's her fault if she's not there for the helping. The three fade off the couch and Willow fades on. It is now morning, and Willow slowly wakes. She walks over to the a phone and calls Giles, but does not reach him, hearing that he's in a counsel meeting all day.

He admits to not being ready to reveal himself to her until    he was ready to face the fight himself. It is then learned that he knew who    she was before he was even hired. She wonders how he knows about Slayers. "Ok...    see, when i was a little boy, my Mother was one. THE one actually, the Slayer."    Wood admits. This news hits Buffy hard with surprise.

He says he did the avenging son thing in    his 20's but eventually learned he may never find the vampire that did it, so    he just continues to fight the fight, hoping to come across the one who killed    her sometime. He admits to not being popular with the Vampire population, reasoning    that's why they probably got jumped outside.

From behind come Buffy and Xander. Buffy asks if Dawn is ok. Dawn says    she is, and that she's thinking of doing some research on the First to help    out. Buffy calls out to the SIT's, asking them downstairs so they can get their    newest arrival up to speed. The girls all head off towards the basement, all    passing by Dawn without notice, except for a "thank you" type of smile    from Amanda.

After talking to his strait-jacketed friend, Giles confirms there is a creature called a She-Mantis, who lures male virgins to her nest. An extremely powerful foe, it was the She-Mantis who put Giles friend into his deranged condition. Buffy suggests that Giles record some bat sonar from the video library -- playing that for the She-Mantis will disrupt her nervous system.

Buffy punches Faith. Faith punches her back. They assume their fighting stances and a knockdown-drag out battle to the death ensues. The fight takes the Slayers all over Faith's apartment and crashing out of her window and onto the rooftop. When they land, Buffy slaps a handcuff onto Faith's wrist with the other cuff attached to her own. The battle continues between the two handcuffed Slayers until Faith breaks the chain on the handcuffs and grabs a long steel pole while Buffy pulls out Faith's dagger. Faith sees her blade and says: "That's mine" to which Buffy responds: "You're about to get it back". Enraged Faith strikes at Buffy with the pole, with Buffy dodging the attack. Buffy then slashes at Faith twice. Faith dodged the first slash and caught Buffy's arm in the second attempt, grabbing her nemesis and throwing her a few feet to land on top of the building's central cooling unit at the roof's edge. Faith prepares to throw Buffy from the rooftop but Buffy breaks free of Faith's grip and plunges the knife into her abdomen. Both Slayers are more than a little shocked. "You did it", says Faith to a horrified Buffy, before delivering a powerful backhanded punch to Buffy's face- knocking her several feet backward to land on her back- barely conscious. "You killed me", Faith goes on. Then, noticing an approaching flatbed semi-truck, Faith steps onto the ledge and continues, "Still won't help your boy, though. You should've been there, B. Quite a ride." Faith then falls back off the roof and into the passing truck.   Buffy rushes to the ledge and sees the truck drive away with Faith, who she believes is dead, as well as the blood Buffy needed to cure Angel.

Despite his encouragement that she is not losing her edge, Buffy wants to research ways to avoid making more mistakes. She and Giles start looking in the Watcher diaries for information about past Slayers' deaths, but Giles tells her there won't be much information because the Watchers usually also died or found it too painful to recount the incidents. Buffy then remembers they have another witness to Slayers' final battles: Spike.

In the Summer's home, Dawn is at a laptop, researching up demons who skin people. She is really into the computer research, asking for gory details in a matter-of-fact tone. Buffy and Xander walk aside, talking apart from Dawn, wondering if it is Willow responsible for the death. Buffy admits she thinks Willow did this, but then Dawn interrupts, saying she's found a good one, a demon called Gnarl. The demon has claws that paralyzes it's victims, allowing it to then slowly peel off strips of skin to eat while the victim watches. Buffy questions why Dawn thinks this particular demon is the one. Dawn says they never mentioned blood, to which the research says Gnarl laps up the blood as a drink, leaving little behind. Now all they have to do is find the demon. Xander suggests Willy, but Buffy says we could be smart, accidentally insulting Xander and apologizing for it. She has a better idea, saying whoever did this had to have gotten blood on them...

It's 9:24pm at Sunnydale airport, people disembark a plane, walking into the terminal. A child goofs off and his father reprimands him. Xander, Buffy, and Dawn wait for Willow's plane to arrive, with Xander holding a large sign that reads "Welcome home Willow" in a very hard to read light yellow. Buffy and Dawn say she won't see the sign, it's so light, and they question why. Xander begins to talk about his heroic speech when confronting evil Willow, but then stops, realizing Dawn is being sarcastic. Dawn starts to get nervous, wondering what to do, how to handle seeing Willow again. Buffy wonders what to say. Xander suggests "Hi Willow." Buffy wonders how he can be so calm. Xander says he has faith in Giles, knowing that he wouldn't let Willow leave unless she was fully recovered, which Dawn agrees with with a "right." Buffy gives a sour look, which makes Dawn question "right?" Buffy admits to them that Willow wasn't completely ready, but that Giles said she had to come back early, she was doing really well, and they shouldn't worry. Just then Xander notices that there is still a problem... Willow is still nowhere in sight, and no more people are entering the terminal

However, when she finds the book, Buffy also finds the witch symbol in one of Willow's notebooks. Before Willow can explain, a search of all the school lockers begins in order to find any material that may be witch-related. Students found with anything questionable are sent to the principal's office. Willow tells Buffy that the symbol is harmless and that she was not doing anything wrong, just making a protection spell for Buffy's upcoming birthday.

All of Giles' books are confiscated by the police, leaving the Slayer and Watcher without their resources.

Marching into his apartment, Xander lays out the ground rules for living in his house as Buffy and Dawn walk in behind him. He turns to an exasperated, uninvited Spike, who's standing at the doorway. Xander then reluctantly, halfheartedly invites him in, and it is revealed that Buffy has insisted that Spike needs to leave the basement of Sunnydale High because of his deteriorating mental state, and he has to stay with Xander, at least for the short term, because he has nowhere else to go, a plan that Xander makes no effort to hide his disgust with. Buffy is certain that the events that occurred between the two in "Seeing Red" will not repeat themselves, now that Spike has a soul, though Xander and Dawn remain somewhat skeptical, and Buffy even briefly recoils in shock when Spike grabs her arm while trying to talk to her. Though both Spike and Xander are certain that the arrangement will not work, Buffy is certain that it already is working because, aside from one episode, Spike has "stopped talking to invisible people".

Willow hurries over to Giles' place to notify everyone that she has talked to the real Xander and they talked to the demon Toth, who is allegedly impersonating Xander. Buffy, Riley and Giles reflect about how the Xander they spoke to did seem different - more confident and forceful. Looking out from behind a book, Giles informs the gang that neither Xander is a demon. The rod-like device Toth blasted Xander with splits a person in half, distilling personality traits into two separate bodies. One body keeps the stronger traits while the other possesses the weaker traits. Riley asks which Xander is the real one. Giles deduces that both are Xander and the two halves can't exist without each other. Therefore, Toth's original plan was to split Buffy and kill the weaker half, which would kill her all together. Back at the apartment, the two Xanders argue while a confused Anya can only watch. The stronger Xander threatens to take care of the weaker Xander, but the weaker Xander thwarts his attempt by pulling out a gun. Anya and the strong Xander reach for the gun, and soon, all of them are grasping the gun, waving it in the air. As Buffy and Riley race to Xander's new apartment, she asks him if he wishes that she was the one who got split into two people. The stronger Buffy would be the Slayer and the weaker would be the regular Buffy Summers, the one that Riley loves. Riley disagrees and tells her that a big part of being Buffy is being the Slayer. He reassures her that there is no part of her that he's not in love with.

"New York City, 1977" the caption reads. It's    dark as it shows the skyline and raining hard. From above we watch a punkish    Spike in mid battle with Slayer Nikki. Both dripping wet, they exchange kicks    and barbs. From behind a park bench we see a pair of small eyes peer out between    the bench's slats, watching the fight. Just as Spike seems to have the upper    hand, Nikki regains control, until Spike has Nikki again, her arm behind her    back, he's ready for the kill. Then the young boy behind the bench bumps a garbage    can, which distracts Spike and let's Nikki break free. Nikki quickly reacts,    throwing a stake at Spike like a knife, but Spike catches it between his hands,    inches away from his chest, then lets it clatter to the ground. Spike brings    the fight to a hault, saying he doesn't want "the dance" to end so    soon as he talks to Nikki, even calling her by name. He says he's been looking    for her for a while, before he starts to walk off and up to the edge of the    wall. Before dropping, he smiles at her and says "By the way... love the    coat."

Xander decides that, since Buffy hasn't returned, he should go after her. He meets up with Coach Marin and fights him for the gun.

Xander looks down into the hole and sees Buffy, up to her waist in sewer water, surrounded by Gill Monsters who are about to attack and slaughter her. He pulls her out before they can do so. (Note this is the second time in one and the same episode that someone has conveniently shown up at the last possible moment to rescue Buffy, of all people, from certain doom.) Coach Marin wakes up and bashes Xander's head with a pipe wrench, incapacitating but not killing him. Marin tries to do the same with Buffy, but Buffy ducks and trips him - accidentally causing him to fall into the hole. She tries to catch him, but misses. Being no match for the Gill Monsters in their element, Buffy can only observe as they close in and rip the Coach to pieces - literally biting the hand that feeds them.

He won't choose between his girlfriend & his best friend. Luckily, he didn't have to. Buffy comes in & after the troll gets her really mad when he says that Anya & Xander's relationship won't last (she's upset about Riley so she's all sensitive about love criticism), she kicks his ass long enough for Willow to send him away- probably to the land of the trolls. Where there are lots of trolls... Finally, Giles comes home. The Council couldn't help him immediately- they don't know anything off-hand or on easy reference- but they are going to look into Glory & The Key. Joyce, Buffy, & Giles discuss this & the unsettling possibility of what the Council would do if they found out that Dawn was The Key- unaware that Dawn is listening in on their conversation from the next room- so Dawn now knows that her mother, her sister, & her sister's Watcher know something about her that she doesn't even know about herself & that someone may be after her.

"There's a    button marked 'clock set' for pity's sake. What kind of a nerd are you?"    Andrew is scared and starts to back away from the visage of Johnathan/the First,    pulling out a wooden cross and trying to "rebuke" the image. Johnathan/the    First sighs and walks calmly up to Andrew. The First waves his hand right through    the cross, sarcastically saying "ooo, ahhh, it burns as it ineffectually    passes through me. I'm not corporeal, remember? Also... not a vampire, so...    a cross?" Andrew, still shaken, asks very hesitantly "what do you    want from me Johnathan-slash-the First?" (I'm sorry, but I'm going to pat    myself on the back here, thinking that line came from my use of naming the First    in such a manner. giggle).

While Giles and the gang are shocked to hear a description of the exact same dream, Buffy is more concerned with her growing irritation and hatred for Kathy. Later that night, the two green-eyed demons stand before a fire and begin to summon another named Tapparich. When Buffy returns to her dorm room, she finds Parker talking to Kathy inside. Apparently, they have been talking and getting to know each other for quite some time before Buffy walked in. After Parker leaves, Buffy and Kathy face off once again. This time, Buffy decides to help herself to as much of Kathy's carton of milk as she can handle. Elsewhere, Willow worries about Buffy steady change in personality. Oz tells her that he'll go find Buffy and see what's up. On his way to Buffy's patrol route, Oz passes by a group of students. One of them, a short girl, draws Oz's attention for a brief moment. As Oz looks back, the girl also does a double take with Oz, sensing something. Figuring it's nothing, Oz continues forward, failing to notice the army of rifle-carrying soldiers running towards the girl and her friends. During the patrol, Buffy tries to put her hatred for Kathy into words, but she only ends up destroying a park bench with a kick of pure hatred. Before going to bed, Buffy tries to get some reading homework done. However, Kathy's toenail clipping proves way more distracting than it should be. In retaliation, Buffy starts tapping her pencil. What follows is Cher's "Believe", Buffy's earmuffs, and the torturous crunching of Kathy's hard-boiled egg shell. Having had enough, Buffy goes to bed and has the same nightmare she had the previous night.

That night, during a patrol, Buffy comes across Eddie in a deserted part of campus and is surprised to realise he is now a vampire, and dusts him quickly when he attacks.

"What? I just refrained from kicking your ass!"    Buffy walks in, surprised. Robin goes on to tell her that she doesn't have time    for this job, she's got more important things to do. With things the way they    are, half the kids aren't even showing up to class, and there's really no place    for her there. She needs to concentrait on the mission. He says that she has    to look at the big picture. Buffy muses, then says she isn't ready for this    war, remarking that some of the girls haven't even seen combat. Robin suggests    that maybe she should test them. Buffy then tries to change the subject, wondering    if she could put up fliers around the school for an encounter group. "And    you're fired again" Robin says. Then he gets serious, saying that the mission    is what matters. Buffy understands.

In the courtyard at school, Buffy tries to rescue Cordelia from an aggressive suitor, but he easily knocks Buffy down, leaving Cordelia to fight the guy off herself. At this point, Buffy really begins to worry, and enlists the help of her friends to figure out what's wrong. Much to their dismay, the research goes nowhere.

Another beetle breaks free and the two manage to attack The Mayor and Buffy. Both beetles are killed, one with the knife the Mayor gave Faith. The Mayor tells everyone that the box contains "about fifty-billion of these happy little critters" and threatens to open it again if Buffy gives him any trouble. He then leaves, box in hand with Faith following behind, reluctantly leaving behind the knife. Snyder, shocked is standing with a chair, holding it like a shield and Buffy asks: "Snyder, you alive in there?"; Snyder furiously asks the gang why they all couldn't be dealing drugs like normal people.

Buffy freaks as Kendra identifies herself as the Slayer. They realize that Kendra was summoned as the new Slayer when Buffy died -- temporarily drowned, that is. Kendra, too, knows that evil is coming. Near death at daybreak, Angel is dragged from the cell by the guy from the bar -- he dumps him in a sewer and turns him over to Spike and Drusilla. When the new moon comes that night, they will perform the ritual they figured out from the transcriber and Angel will die.
|
Just as she says this, the Mayor strolls into the library, putting everyone on edge. He taunts the gang, and threatens to "eat" Buffy. Giles plunges a fencing saber into his chest, but Wilkins (who is, of course, unharmed) simply chides him for showing violence in front of children before departing, promising "one heck of a speech".

Further investigation reveals that Marcie was in everyone's classes, but no one seems to even remember that she existed. Giles says she simply became invisible because she was perceived that way -- it's all due to physics, helped along by living above a Hellmouth. Marcie's goal seems to be to destroy Cordelia, who is already wigged out by the attacks on people close to her. Cordelia's coronation as May Queen that evening would be the perfect place for Marcie to attack, but Cordelia is none too thrilled about being used as bait. As Cordelia gets ready at school for the dance, Marcie yanks her up through the ceiling. Meanwhile, Giles, Willow and Xander hear some haunting music and try to follow it, hoping to find Marcie. The trio is led to the boiler room where they are overcome by gas fumes. Marcie anesthetizes both Buffy and Cordelia, brings them to the Bronze and ties them up. Marcie, armed with an arsenal of creepy surgical instruments, explains to Cordelia that she intends to give her a face no one will ever forget. She slices Cordelia's cheek, but Buffy manages to free herself and a scuffle ensues. Buffy finally knocks Marcie out, just as a pair of FBI agents arrive to take Marcie away. Angel saves the unconscious gang in the boiler room, but Giles tells Buffy it was a janitor -- he doesn't want to remind Buffy of her lost love. Cordelia acts grateful to the gang, but becomes her normal obnoxious self when her newly-healed boyfriend and her cooler-than-thou friends show up.

Willow prepares the ingredients for a spell that will locate the Potential Slayer and surround her with a glowing aura. The spell is performed at the fireplace, but at first it doesn't succeed, just creates a horrible smell. Dawn tries to open a door to air out the room, but the light follows her, knocking her into the door and surrounding her. Dawn starts to freak out at the news that she's the latest Potential Slayer. She's worried that her becoming a slayer would mean her sister would have to die first. Dawn doesn't want to tell Buffy what's going on and goes upstairs to think alone while the rest of the gang debate the pros and cons of the situation and telling Buffy. Dawn overhears the conversation and feeling the weight of their concerns and her potential fate of death, she sneaks out the window.

The wind picks up and Willow stands, hair flying and a eery  orange glowing vapor enters her nostrils from a spell-casting bowl in front of  her. Buffy looks on wide-eyed as Willow looks up, reminiscent of her Dark Willow  persona, with black eyes and black hair. Then from her mouth, the form of the  First comes out, with huge horns and glowing, demonic eyes (trust me, folks. It  looks REAL cool). Willow opens her mouth again and orange lightning comes out,  sending Buffy flying into the front hall with a blast. "You will only make me  stronger!" Willow says in a demonic voice. Xander then rushes over, grabs the  glowing spell bowl, and smashes it against the wall. Willow collapses as Buffy  rushes over to her. Willow panics "It's still in me, I feel it..." Buffy tries  to calm her, telling her it's ok, it's not in her. Willow is very panicked,  saying she can't use magic, she doesn't want to hurt people. Buffy tells her  they won't use magic to fight the First and still tries to calm her.

Willow goes to check on Buffy, but instead encounters Dawn in the hallway. When Tara appears wearing just a sheet, Dawn is thrilled to see they are back together.

Glory brags to Dawn about her superiority but Dawn knows there is one person who can beat the goddess: Buffy. Meanwhile, in Buffy's mind, Willow visits a 20-year-old Buffy at her house. Buffy calmly acknowledges that death is her gift, before going to Dawn's room and smothering the young girl with a pillow, much to Willow's horror. Glory finds her body taken over by Ben and after some encouragement from Dawn, Ben takes her and runs. Willow watches as scenes from earlier begin to repeat and baby Dawn is brought home again.

Packing up the candles and other Wiccan supplies, Amy tells    Kennedy that the others took off, that all of the Willow/Warren stuff was a    bit too creepy, even for them. Amy then can see the concern on Kennedy's face    and says that she can tell she's really worried about Willow. Amy tries to comfort    her by saying Willow is strong and has been through a lot worse, "long    before she ever went out and found herself a big strong potential Slayer bodyguard."    Kennedy says she never said she was a potential Slayer. Amy tries to backtrack,    but then suddenly admits she's busted. "oops..."

In the basement of the school, Andrew and Johnathan look at the map, confused by the labrynth of the place. Andrew's scared, thining it's like Hellraiser. Johnathan grabs the map from him and then wonders if they circled around. Andrew then shines his light on a far door which Warren stands in front of. It is Spike's old joint in the basement! Johnathan shines his flashlight on the same door, not seeing Warren's form. Johnathan looks at the map and says he might be right.
|
Johnathan gets out of bed and goes off to the bathroom as    Andrew tries to calm himself by singing "La Cucaracha", but he turns    in bed to see Warren/the First standing over him. "Did you get the knife?"    The First asks a visibly shaken Andrew. Some small talk between the two before    Warren/the First asks again if Andrew has the knife. Andrew says yes, he had    to go and get it from a demon-guy who sells all sorts of strange weapons. Andrew    takes out a box from under the bed and takes out an ornate dagger (not like    the Bringer's curved blades). Warren/the First asks about Johnathan. Andrew    says he's got a shy bladder and he'll be a while, then re-enforces the shyness    by calling out to Johnathan and asking if he's ok? "Don't talk to me, I'm    fine." says an out of shot Johnathan. Andrew then questions the killing    part of the plan, but Warren/the First says that "that boy's" blood    is special and important to the plan, and if all goes well they'll be treated    like gods. Andrew thinks of the words and drifts off

At the library, Giles says good-bye to the shrouded man, revealing that the mysterious figure had come to Giles at the beginning and put on a light show in order to pay back a debt the man owed Giles for introducing him to his wife. Wesley is very upset that Giles did all this behind his back, and plans to tell the Watchers Council about it; Giles surprises him by saying that he should, remarking that he can think of nothing more dangerous than a rogue Slayer. Now that everyone is fully aware of Faith's having switched sides, they have to prepare to fight her as well.

Despite her anger over his betrayal, Willow doesn't want Oz to leave. Unfortunately, Oz's mind is already made up, and he leaves behind the one woman he truly loves. As tears flow forcefully from Willow's eyes, Oz can no longer hold back his agony.

Willow finds the fraternity house full of blood and corpses. There is a young co-ed whimpering in the closet that she "takes it back." She tearfully explains how in response to a cruel fraternity stunt she made a rhetorical wish about "having their hearts ripped out," after which a giant spider demon appeared and did just that. The spider attacks Willow and the girl, but Willow uses magic to hold it at bay, actually making a harsh style comment (disturbingly evocative of "Dark Willow") to the girl before tossing the spider through a window and comforting the girl, her normal self again.

Camera view, and Spike is pissed at Andrew's filming him.    "I thought I told you to piss off with this bloody camera. Any here you    are with this thing in my face." Spike flicks his cigarrette in the camera's    lens "Just sod off, or I'll rip your throat out and eat..." Andrew    then interrupts, telling Spike that he stepped forward, getting the light behind    him. "Oh, oh right." Spike sighs and walks back into the light of    a nearby light "This better then?" He prepares himself and starts    again: "I thought I told you to piss off with that bloody camera, yet here    you are again with that thing in my face. Just sod off..."

Morning at the Summer's home, Buffy and Giles walk in early  to find all three SIT's in the kitchen, eagerly munching away on breakfast  stuffs. They notice that Buffy looks a little bit shaken. Buffy says she just  got in a little fight, but doesn't know with what and asks Giles. Giles wonders  if this conversation shouldn't be private, motioning to the SIT's. "You mean not  in front of the next generation? No time to coddle them, Giles. Welcome to the  war room, guys." Buffy says to the SIT's, which perks their interest (and sends  Annabelle grabbing a pad and paper to make notes.). Giles tells Buffy that what  she fought was a Turok-Han, the Neanderthal equivalent of a Vampire. They're  animalistic and vicious, and are "The vampires that vampires fear." Giles says  that they're an entirely different race and, up until that morning, the thought  they were a myth. Buffy wonders if it's a co-incidence that the Turok-han and  the First are both appearing now. Giles says it's more likely the UberVamp is an  agent of the First. "Um... did you slay it?" Asks Annabelle, a little nervously.  "No, it's still out there somewhere..." Buffy says, defeatedly. She tells them  that Sunlight seems to be keeping the UberVamp at bay, which gets Giles to  suggest that Buffy get some sleep. Buffy says she can't, she's got to work and  do research at the same time. Buffy then turns to the SIT's and apologizes that  there's not much more to do than sit tight for now. Buffy heads out to work as  Giles asks how she's going to research "something as ill-defined as the First?"  Buffy says she has ways...

He then changes the subject to tracking down the commandos, telling Buffy that based on their information it seems that the base is below UC Sunnydale and that other students may be involved.

It's time to expose Riley's freakish nighttime fetish. Spike leads the Slayer to Riley's nocturnal hang, revealing the strange suckfest, really throwing Buff for a loop.

Buffy dispatches the vampires, but when she announces she is the Slayer, one vampire runs away, though Buffy does kill the blond vampire who had attacked Willow.

Glory prepares for the ritual to open the portal, talking to her minions and Dawn, who is tied up and gagged on a chair. Spike reports that he can't see Glory anywhere, but the gang has a new problem as Buffy has been reduced to a state of catatonia. Spike tries to violently shake Buffy back to normal, which only leads to a fight with Xander, and Willow forces them apart with magic. Willow takes command and quickly formulates a plan with both Buffy and Giles incapacitated: the Scoobies are to return to Sunnydale, with Xander taking Giles to the hospital, Anya looking after Tara, and Spike tracking down Glory while Willow helps Buffy. After mentioning that Ben and Glory share a body, Spike realizes that Glory's magic makes the humans forget that bit of information every time it's revealed to them.

Meanwhile, Buffy and Angel  confront their feelings for each other and Angel owns up to his past relationship with Drusilla .
|
The next day, Ms. Calendar is teasing Giles about their date, which she is planning but won't give him any details on. Buffy reports her patrolling but omits any Angel references. Later in class, she passes notes to Willow about the Angel-Drusilla sighting while the rest of the class is discussing Marie Antoinette. In the hallways, Xander tries to make his way into the conversation but fails, just as another young man sneaks up behind Buffy and surprises her. She introduces him to Willow and Xander as her friend Ford from L.A., with whom she attended school for 7 years. He explains that his dad has been transferred and he's finishing his senior year at Sunnydale High. They make plans to go to The Bronze that night before Buffy walks Ford to the Admissions Office.

At school, the night of the double date, Willow is in the chemistry lab, working on the ingredients for her anti-love spell. Xander shows up, and they begin arguing when he figures out what Willow is doing. Spike comes in, still very drunk, and attacks Xander, announcing that he needs to borrow Willow for a while. Spike takes Xander, unconscious from a head wound, and Willow back to the factory, where he locks them up. Spike explains his situation to Willow, first threatening her life if she fails to cast an effective spell, then sitting next to her tells Willow that Dru had thought he had gone soft after his alliance with Buffy, and was not "demon enough" for her anymore. The final blow had come when he caught Dru cheating on him with a Chaos Demon (described by Spike as all "slime and antlers") then told him that they could still be friends. An uncomfortable Willow tries to half-heartedly comfort the distraught Spike. When Willow tells Spike that she doesn't have enough ingredients, he takes her list and goes to collect what she needs.

Out of self-preservation, Ben agrees, and hands Dawn over to Glory's minions.

Buffy is awakened by Anya in Buffy and Willow's dorm room, only to switch to her own room at home where she talks to Tara. She wonders where her friends are, since they were supposed to come over to watch movies. The Primitive roars in Buffy's face, and she suddenly finds herself at home in her own bed. She gets out and looks at the sheets, saying that she and Faithhad made the bed.Tara tells her she's lost them.

As the bus races along the street, suddenly we see something    else... a figure running atop the buildings beside the bus! The very ground    behind the bus is giving way into a huge, expanding crater, with the vehichle    and running gigure both barely keeping ahead of it's expanding edge. With scythe    in hand, Buffy runs and long-jumps between buildings, keeping up with the bus,    looking for the right time to jump. Just as Dawn spots her sister running, Buffy    makes one desperate jump and lands on the roof of the Bus!
|
Giles now comes in the front door with armloads of shopping    bags and Chao-Ann in tow. He complains about the busyness of the mall and the    "sticky" food court as Chao-Ann stands silently smiling. Xander says    it must be rough on her, bringing up the learning of her potential slayerhood    and being uprooted from her home. Giles says the language barrier is also making    it tough. "I was concerned that my Mandarin was thin, but as it turns out    she speaks Cantonese... which is... thinner." Giles then says she's happy    though because Ice Cream is the universal language, which prompts Chao-Ann to    say (in Cantonese, with English Subtitles) "Like many from Asia, I am lactose    intolerant. I'm very uncomfortable." "What she say?" Buffy asks    akwardly. "She's grateful to be in the land of plenty" Giles says    as Chao-Ann smiles and nods. Giles and Chao-Ann depart upstairs to put away    her new clothes as Buffy asks Willow to do a computer search on Principal Wood.    Willow says no problem, then offers to do the same with Xander's date. Xander    waves her off, saying it's ok, he's gonna go in blind on this one.

Pinned below the Vampire, Dawn struggles and screams for    Amanda's help, but Amanda is too shaken and in shock to help. Just as the vamp    is about to bite Dawn, the windows of the classroom smash open! Three figures    come bounding in the room! Surprised, the vampire is distracted enough for Dawn    to kick him off. The three figures are Bringers! And they march in and quickly    grab hold of... Amanda! "No! you don't want her!" Dawn shouts, but    suddenly confusion hits her. "you want me" she says timidly. Amanda    is terrified in the Bringer's grasp as the truth starts to "dawn"    on young Summers (sorry, couldn't resist the pun).
|
A short while later, Willow returns to her room and tells Buffy about an aftershock party at Porter Hall, due to the entire building being blacked out.  Buffy turns down the invitation, instead heading over to Giles for some answers.  While Buffy fears that something bad is coming, Giles insists that the earthquake was nothing out of the ordinary.  Meanwhile, Spike finds himself sinking deeper and deeper into depression.  No longer the fearsome night stalker he once was, Spike cannot comprehend how he ended up living in Xander's basement.  Underground, Riley asks Forrest about the Slayer.  According to Forrest, the Slayer is nothing but a myth. Over at the aftershock party, Willow runs into Percy West, whom she tutored last year at Sunnydale High.  In another room, a lone student finds himself in a sudden encounter with a large, green demon with several spines protruding from the back of its head.  Before he can run or scream, the demon slashes the boy's throat, spilling blood all over the floor.

Buffy recovers and pulls Spike off Andrew; she knocks Spike out with a powerful kick. Buffy talks to the gang about Spike's strange behavior and based on Buffy's information, Xander concludes that Spike is being manipulated by a posthypnotic trigger, in military style.

After having a nice time at the party, Buffy and Parker discuss Parker's decision to take History and he speaks about making choices. Buffy finds herself enraptured with Parker's deep thoughts, and afterwards decides to make her own choice and sleeps with him.
|
After the climactic battle on the roof of Faith's apartment building, Buffy stands alone with the knife that may have killed Faith.  As the reality of not being able to use Faith's blood as a cure for Angel sets in, Buffy has a moment of painfully quiet introspection, then leaves, having made her decision internally.  Just as Buffy descends the escape ladder, the Mayor and one of his goons search the apartment looking for Faith.  The apartment is in a shambles, and although the Mayor tries to convince himself that Faith will prevail in the fight, his fear is written all over his face.
|
Then she finally reveals to Sweet and her friends that, by resurrecting her, they had ripped her out of heaven rather than rescuing her from some kind of hell dimension as they had thought they had. As her friends react in horror to the admission (Willow especially) and once she has vocalized her anger and despair, she dances maniacally to the point of smoking, in a somewhat suicidal effort. Spike arrives and helps her recover, comforting her by telling her that the only way to mend her wounds is to carry on living, "so one of us is living" ("Something to Sing About").

Meanwhile the man-demon-machine Adam that Professor Walsh created is roaming Sunnydale and even Buffy can't seem to stop him.
|
Later, Willow presents the antidote to Buffy in a mug and leaves her to drink it as Spike delivers a monologue urging her to abandon the life that's grown so hellish for her and choose peace with him. This misfires, convincing Buffy to reject the antidote  and with it, the 'delusion' of being a Vampire Slayer. In the hospital, Buffy tells the doctor and her parents that she wants to be healthy and rid of thoughts about Sunnydale. The doctor tells her that she has to do what is necessary to destroy the elements that draw her back there, like her family and friends, in order to truly be healthy.

Back in the slaughterhouse that was the Frat room, Anya's hand caresses a blood covered wall in confustion. "I thought I might find you here" says Xander, walking in the front door. Anya rolls her eyes and asks what he wants. Xander says he wants to help her. Anya smirks briefly, saying everyone is so helpful and she should have killed people weeks ago. Xander says he's sorry, he's sorry for everything that he put her through. "Thank you. All better. Thank goodness you got here in time!" Anya says sarcastically. Xander says he's trying to help her because Buffy is on her way to kill her. "She's going to try." says Anya coldly. Xander wonders how the two of them could think like this with them being friends. Any knew that this was always coming, and accuses Xander of not wanting to realize it. Buffy appears, standing in the doorway, sword drawn. Buffy tells Xander to get out of the way, to which he says no. Anya does the same, but puts on her game face and them backhands him aside and off to the ground.

Buffy tells Giles that Dawn is The Key that Glory is hell-bent on finding, and speaks of her struggle to come to terms with the fact that the majority of her memories of Dawn are false. They decide to protect Dawn without telling others about it. In order to be able to protect Dawn properly, Buffy moves out of the college dorm and returns to living at home, citing to her friends that the reason was her mom's recent health issues.

At school the next day, the sight of Parker drives Buffy out of the cafeteria just minutes into the lunch period. Willow tries to help out, but Buffy prefers the easy way out. Her growing preoccupation does not go unnoticed by Professor Walsh, who threatens to kick Buffy out of the class if she has any more absences. Riley suggests to Buffy that she should take a break from her worries and just have fun for Halloween. Meanwhile, Josh and Edward, two members of the Alpha Delt fraternity, prepare their house for a haunted party. While Josh puts the finishing touches on a knife-wielding skeleton, Edward hands over a bag of fake spiders, as well as a book that contains an appropriate symbol to add to the party's freaky ambience. When Josh complains about their stereo system's quality, Edward offers to call Oz to remedy the situation. After school, Oz brings his stereo over to the Alpha Delt house, with Xander tagging along. As Oz sets up the new sound system, Xander notices the symbol being painted on the floor of the attic by Chaz, another fraternity member. Oz accidentally cuts his finger while trying to tweak the sound quality by trimming the speaker wire. When he shakes some blood onto the floor, the painted symbol sends a rippling shockwave throughout the house that nobody notices. Suddenly, what was once a fake, plastic spider resting on the floor is now a living, walking creature.

In unison, the Demon and all of the Scoobs begin singing from different locations. Everyone seems to be worried. As the song concludes, Buffy kicks open the door to the Bronze ready for battle. As singing commences between Buffy and the demon, the rest of the gang shows up. Carelessly, Buffy reveals her trip to Heaven and then begins dancing out of control. Still angry with her, Spike holds her so that she doesn't explode. Things wind down and the demon informs the Scoobs that he must take Dawn because she summoned him with the talisman. To Sweets chagrin, we find out that Xander actually summoned the sharp-dressed monster. After one last verse, the demon leaves them all with a final note about being truthful.
|
As she resumes her patrolling duties, Buffy hears a woman screaming and follows the sound. She is soon disoriented as time seems to jump between the crying woman, an attack by several demons, and Spike finding Buffy in the woods. In the end, Buffy strikes out at something and instead of hitting one of the demons, she hits the woman whom the viewer recognizes as Katrina. Katrina's body rolls down the hill as Buffy rushes behind trying to catch her. When Buffy finally does catch up, she realizes that Katrina is dead and assumes that the blow she dealt killed her. Behind a tree, another Katrina watches.
|
Crying softly, Spike begins to gather up the scattered bills, but his feelings of sadness and humiliation are quickly overtaken by anger and hatred. Furious, Spike returns to his crypt and arms himself with a double-barreled shotgun, intent on killing Buffy for her final insult. Harmony begs him to reconsider his plan because he has tried and failed so many times before. She reminds him that the chip in his head will not let him hurt a human, and the Slayer will only beat him up again, if not stake him outright. Spike retorts that his pain will last for a couple of hours, and Buffy will be dead much longer than that.

That's because Buffys kicking in the door to the Evil Trio's lair. The Nerds are missing,           so she checks out some files and books strewn about the room. When she reads a           white board bearing the words, "TOO LATE", the walls erupt with giant buzz-saws that           Buffy only barely escapes. She grabs what she can of the Trio's papers as she goes.           Meanwhile, in a dank cave, the Trio defeats a giant demon. They strip the creature of his           skin, and Jonathan must wear the gooey pelt to pass through a barrier that can be           penetrated only by demons. While he's gone, the remaining Nerds discuss how they           will be rid of him in due time. Jonathan returns with a box containing the Orbs of           Nezzla'khan. When Warren holds the Orbs, it's apparent they will help him achieve his           goal--invincibility.

"evil" is typed out on an internet search engine (hard to  tell which one... not Google, I know that). Buffy is at work, on the phone with  one of the Scoobies as she types. She says she re-checked the basement for clues  but found nothing. She then hits enter on her search, hoping that the First  isn't ready for modern technology. "Displaying results 1-10 of 900,517" She'll  try and narrow the search a bit. She hangs up and continues searching as  Principal Wood walks up behind her and reads her screen. "Manifestations of  Evil" he reads... then Buffy types further "in the movies". She tries to cover,  saying that she's just looking for some movies to rent. "I just love those evil,  evil movies" she says. "As opposed to Rob Schnieder's Oeuvre." Wood says. Buffy  then sits across from Buffy, saying that he's not a fan of scary movies,  thinking it takes kids to a place they shouldn't be. Buffy says "it's not for  the kids. Wood suddenly gets a little too serious, saying "once you see true  evil, it can have some serious afterburn, and you can't unsee what you saw...  Ever. It's just one opinion." Then he gets up and his mood lightens a tad. Buffy  asks him what kind of movies he likes as he's leaving. Without turning towards  her, he answers "Mysteries. I love finding out what's underneath it all at the  very end."

When Buffy wants to learn more about Slayers of the past and their final battles she heads to the expert. William the Bloody (a.k.a. Spike) has "offed" two Slayers over the years and Buffy wants to know how. Do we really expect Spike to dish the real dirt? Given his latest fantasies and dreams, not to mention the fact that he likes to brag a bit, of course, he does. And class begins for Professor Spike and his Slayer student. Spike's flashbacks reveal the goods. We witness his first meeting with his true love Drusilla and how Angel and Darla ended up joining them to become the gruesome foursome. We see how he killed the two Slayers--who he declares had simply lost the will to live, which is why he was able to overcome them. We also get a look into the man Spike was before he became the vamp he is today. Yes, he was a poet. And a "bloody" bad one at that.

Downstairs, Molly tells several new Slayers-in-Training about the recently killed Anabelle. Xander suggests they be quiet and sleep, but a still-bound and very bored Andrew suggests they speak louder. Buffy arrives with Rona and the gang is updated on the recent activities and findings. The gang lacks answers to most of their current problems like destroying the Turok-Han and rescuing Spike from the First Evil. The Slayers in Training are worried and lacking confidence. Giles suggests they seek answers from an oracle-like creature known as Beljoxa's Eye. Down in the cave where he's kept prisoner, Spike is approached by one of the Bringers, but for once, he fights back and breaks free of the bonds that hold him to a wall. He runs through the underground tunnels and finds Buffy waiting for him, but quickly is pulled away from his dream and into reality where the First Evil, looking like Buffy, is waiting for him.

The fight in the tomb continues and Buffy eventually pins Holden, ready to stake him. "There, you're dead" she says. "OK, but are you going to kill me because I'm evil, or because you opened up to me?" Holden asks. Buffy gets off in disgust and barges a few steps away as Holden gets up and dusts himself off (but not before she kicks him hard because he's smiling). Holden says this is no worry for him, his only concern is whether Patricia showed up at his funeral, because she was hot! Buffy gets mad, wondering what the deal is with vampires talking about nothing but death and sex and love and pain. Holden says it's more a guy thing, but Buffy says no, it's different with vampires because... "believe me, i know." Light dawns on Holden's head as he gets the hint. He then challenges Buffy, knowing that they're still going to fight to the death, but he wants to ask her one question and if he's right, then he gets to talk to her about it, no defenses, no hiding, total openness. She agrees. Holden smirks "Your last relationship... was it with a vampire?"

Spike and Giles both crumple to the ground, but quickly    recover enough to both act surprised at the same time! "You're not the    First!" Spike says. "Your chip didn't go off!" Giles says (both    at the same time). Spike says that Anya told him Giles was the First and that    he was supposed to be all go-throughable, which makes Giles question why Spike    attacked him then. Giles is equally surprised and questions why Spike's chip    didn't go off during the attack. Both Buffy and Spike beat around the bush a    little, but eventually say there was a choice at the initiative and the choice    was made to have the chip removed. This sets Giles off, but he is interrupted    by Kennedy and Amanda questioning what the "chip" is. (in Subtitles,    Chao-Ann says "I don't understand a word any of you are saying" as    she looks around, confused but happy).

In a sundrenched dream, Buffy visits the comatose Faith through some sort of telepathic connection she shares with her fellow slayer.  Just when they seem to be getting along, Faith motions her stomach.  The knife Buffy stabbed her with still protrudes, dripping with blood.  Meanwhile, in Xander's basement, Buffy, Willow and Giles discuss how to destroy the unstoppable Adam, while Xander works on repairing the faulty blaster that Professor Walsh gave Buffy.  The Slayer, however, seems equally concerned with the condition of the injured Riley who is in the questionable care of the Initiative.  Just then, Riley wakes up in the medical unit of the underground headquarters.  As he attempts to leave to see Buffy, Forrest intervenes.  It appears that their standoff can only result in a fight.  Meanwhile, as Faith lies in her own intensive care unit, she dreams of a pleasant picnic with her deceased father figure, Mayor Wilkins III.  The serenity is disrupted when Buffy appears and murders the Mayor with the same knife she stabbed Faith with.  That night, Xander and Willow go on patrol with Buffy in search of Adam.  Instead of finding the demon-cyborg, they come across one of his morbid biology projects.  A red, horned demon is strung up between two trees with his chest cavity splayed open for dissection.  Back in Xander's basement, he and Willow listen to Buffy's plans to liberate Riley from the Initiative headquarters.  Surprisingly, Riley shows up at that moment and embraces Buffy.

Other students    come out from corners and attack, the fight begins! Andrew rushes off into a    corner, filming the fight, as Spike, Robin, and Buffy all punch and kick and    fight a small handfull of students. Towards the end, Spike gets a little too    nasty with one student, punching him hard, which promps Buffy to say "Spike,    don't kill them. They're just students." "They'll live" he snarks    back as he punches one he had pinned once more before moving on.

He mentions he was looking for the "spark" and rambles on, then almost matter of factly, says "Flesh? Am I flesh to you? Feed on flesh... my flesh. Nothing else, not a spark. Fine.

Underground, the Master is unhappy about their escape and punishes the vampire Colin by violently poking his eyes out. Luke then drinks the Master's blood, turning Luke into "the Vessel". Back at the library, Giles explains what he and Willow have discovered; that an ancient vampire, The Master, arrived in Sunnydale with his minions 60 years ago. He intended to open the Hellmouth, which is below Sunnydale - a portal between this reality and another, demonic reality - but he was swallowed by an unexpected earthquake and is now trapped in a church that is buried underground. If the Hellmouth opens, demons will invade the Earth. Tonight is a once-in-a-century opportunity called The Harvest in which, by choosing one of his minions to drink The Master's blood and marking him with the ritual's symbol, the vampire king will draw strength from each of this minion's victims, until he is powerful enough to finally break free from his confinement and resume what he has started decades ago. To prevent this, Buffy and her gang of friends must kill the Vessel. They wonder where the vampires might attack so as to ensure the optimum number of victims, and Xander suggests The Bronze, as he realizes that the vampires have been using it as their feeding ground.

She    knows it might be important and sends Kennedy to search Andrew's things for    it. Andrew stops her for a second, saying the knife is in the kitchen in the    cutlery drawer. Shocked looks all around as Andrew says they didn't have any    steak knives. Spike asks what's so important about the knife. Willow recalls    Andrew saying the First told him about driving the words deep into him, maybe    the knife has writing? Andrew says there was some pattern on the blade, but    he didn't think much of it. Kennedy returns with the dagger and Willow looks    at it briefly before she hands it to Andrew, asking him how he is with demon    languages. It's in Tuarik he says, or rather a very old Tuarik. Wood says now    they know the knife and the language are connected. Andrew says rather silently    that he knows enough about the language and he reads the dagger's blade, which    says "The blood which I spill will concecrate the oldest evil."

Although not happy about it he's been overruled by the school board as, since Buffy is no longer suspected of murder, she is entitled to public education.

The school board has already admitted Buffy back in, a fact that prompts Joyce to take a childish approach to express her delight.

|
The next morning, Principal Snyder calls Buffy to his office to let her know that he'll be keeping an eye on her. After he leaves the office for a minute, a book mysteriously falls out of the bookshelf. Buffy picks it up, noticing that it's a yearbook from the Sunnydale Class of '55. Meanwhile, Giles stops by the computer classroom, where Willow is still serving as the substitute teacher. She tells Giles about some of the files and pagan websites she found on the computer, then gives him a rose quartz that once belonged to Jenny. Elsewhere, Buffy has a dream in one of her classes that she's in the year 1955. She watches on as one of the students approaches the teacher. They start to hold hands when someone else interrupts them. Just then, Buffy wakes up from her dream and notices the teacher writing "Don't walk away from me, bitch" on the chalkboard. He doesn't even notice it until the students start laughing. In the hallway, Buffy tells Xander what happened. When they reach his locker, a rotted arm reaches out of it and grabs Xander, trying to pull him in. Buffy helps him loose, and the creature disappears.

Xander again wonders why Spike is suddenly Buffy's concern, to which Buffy defends back, saying that the school basement is making him crazy and they just can't leave him there. "Why not? Crazy basement guy is better than stalking Buffy guy." Xander argues, to which Dawn agrees and questions whether Buffy and Spike are back together? Buffy vehimently denies it, saying that things are different with Spike having a Soul now. Dawn wonders what Spike having a soul means exactly, to which Buffy has no answer. Spike then reaches to get Buffy's attention and she jumps, slightly uneasy, but then apologizes for her jitteryness. Spike sighs and says it's not going to work and he should go, but Buffy says it's already working, he's been out of the basement for half an hour and hasn't heard the voices (except for one episode in the car on the way over).

Meanwhile in the Magic Box, Giles and Buffy train in case she is expected to fight whatever is causing the singing. Giles asks if Buffy spoke to Dawn about her misbehavior at Halloween, but when Buffy tells him she'd assumed he had sorted it, he realizes she is now depending on him for everything. As Buffy trains, Giles sings his thoughts (heard only by himself) that his continued presence encourages Buffy to remain emotionally dependent on him and that he should no longer act as a father to her lest she never mature, thus he decides to leave again and return to England for good ("Standing"). Tara looks up information on the bramble, which confirms it is used in spells concerning memory alteration. Devastated that Willow would perform such an act against her, Tara decides the relationship should end. Giles and Tara's songs merge into a duet about leaving as they look at Buffy and Willow respectively, the two of whom are distractedly chatting.

Into the drawing room walks William's mother, hobbling    with a cane. She is frantic, saying she's been worrying about him for days.    William smiles and says that she no longer has to worry about anything again,    that everything will be ok. Anne (William's Mother) notices Drusilla and asks    who she is. "I'm the other that gave birth to your son" Drusilla answers.    Anne is confused as William smiles again and takes Drusilla by the hand, saying    that she made him who he now is "I am no longer bound by this mortal coil.    I have become a creature of the night." "Are you drunk?" Anne    asks, shocked and puzzled. "A little bit" he admits. He talks to her,    talks to her of a life without sickness or death, and that he wants to do this    for her. Anne is still confused as William approaches lovingly, embracing his    Mother. "It's all right mother, it's only me. We'll be together forever..."    as he puts on his game face and bites at his Mother's neck. "It only hurts    for a moment."

Buffy then engages with Adam. She rushes clumsily at him, but is knocked away with a punch to the gut. Rebounding quickly, Buffy and Adam exchange a high volume of blows: Buffy breaks the Polgara demon spike on Adam's left arm, but he reveals his right arm has been "upgraded" to a giant machine gun. Bombarded with gunfire, the Slayer runs behind a computer console for cover. Much like their previous encounters, Adam is clearly the superior, until the enjoining spell kicks in: Giles, Willow and Xander, by invoking the powers of the Slayer lineage , merge their psyches in Buffy's body to form a fighter with Buffy's physical strength , Willow's magic power , Xander's bravery  and Giles's knowledge . This composite being rises from the ashes, repelling Adam's missiles with a shield, and shutting his weapons arm down with a wave of the hand.

Yep, still night-time, this time in a graveyard. A young    blond girl runs full speed through the cemetary, looking around paniced.

Spike stands up, ready to square off against Faith. She gets first    licks in, punching Spike hard and sending him reeling. "Let me guess...    Leather pants, nice right cross, doe-eyes, holyer-than-though glower... you    must be Faith" Spike says, not fighting back, on the defensive. Faith says    she knows him, they've met. Spike starts to say he doesn't recall, but then    is hit a few times. "Bloody hell! What are you doing? I'm on your side!"    Spike says, a bit surprised. Faith says that he probably hasn't heard that she's    reformed now and hits him again. Spike says he's reformed too and now starts    to fight back, hitting her across the face. The two exchange blows as Spike    says "stop punch hitting punch me punch!" "What do you    think? i'm stupid?" Faith asks. "Well, yeah" Spike answers.

"Let me tell you something about Buffy. In fact you    all should listen to this. I've been through more battles with Buffy than you    all can ever imagine.

This girl has died two times and she's still standing. you're scared, that's    smart. You got questions, you should. But you doubt her motives, you think Buffy's    all about the kill, you take the little bus to battle. I've seen her heart,    and this time not litterally, and I'm telling you right now she cares more about    your lives than you will ever know. You've gotta trust her. She's earned it."

Buffy tries to adjust to life in Sunnydale.

Buffy assures Flutie that there won't be any problems like at her old school and she is "Here to have fun. But I mean learning, fun with learning." Flutie tells Buffy not to worry, he thinks she will fit in just fine. Meanwhile, a gawky guy and an overweight girl (later to be known as Xander and Willow) talk, and he asks her to help him with his homework and Willow agrees after being promised the reward of a shiny nickel. A jock asks a fashionable, pretty but mean girl (later known as Cordelia Chase, and accompanied by two lackeys later known as Harmony and Cordette) out to the Bronze and she declines him. Her ditzy blonde companion, Harmony, confirms that they're still going. Cordelia asks who is playing that night and Harmony tells her it's Dingoes Ate My Baby. Cordelia surveys the group of her fellow students and mocks them one by one, until Xander interrupts. Cordelia ridicules him and leave, just as Buffy, looking through her bag and not paying attention to where she is going, bumps into Xander, causing her to drop her things. She gathers what she has dropped as Xander apologizes, and she asks him where the library is. He helps her out but when she leaves, he discovers she has forgotten the sharpened wooden stake she'd been carrying. The library is deserted and Buffy attempts to leave, but bumps into Giles. He recognizes her instantly. She starts to ask him for some school books she needs, but Giles cuts her short and says he has what's she is looking for, and places a large, ancient book in front of her entitled Vampyr. Disturbed, Buffy tells Giles that's not whats she's looking for and hurries out, leaving a confused Giles behind.

Walking through a forest, an axe-carrying Buffy and Xander look hunt for the Spider demon. Buffy thanks Xander for coming. Xander says it's no problem, better than doing Freon work at the site. They talk briefly about Willow returning to school and her being a little more nervous than she led on, but just around a tree they stumble upon a dead body, a large hole in it's chest. "How big did she say this thing was?" asks Xander, now having second thoughts, but Buffy says Willow wouldn't send them out there if they couldn't handle it. Buffy notes the heart is completely ripped out, confirming it's the spider demon. Xander sees some black viney things hanging from a tree and after grabbing it, "Yuck, it's sticky!" Buffy points out that it is a spider demon, so it goes to figure. They both hear rustling up in the tree above and try to look, but with the sun and branches, they can't tell. A long, black web-vine shoots down and strikes Xander, but Buffy quickly pushes him aside as the spider demon drops and is instantly on top of Buffy. The demon struggles to lower it's three pronged mouth down to her chest as she tries to push it away, then she launches it in the air over hear head. It lands and then instantly scurries up a tree. Buffy and Xander re-group, looking up in the tree, trying to spot it. "I think we need more swords" says Xander "I say we go home and pick up some more swords and some sort of spidery-demon protection..." But he trails off as he sees Buffy throw her axe up into the tree with force. We hear a thud, a squeal, and then see the spider-demon drop to the ground, the axe imbedded in it's chest. "or..." xander responds.

When he confronts Larry alone in the gym locker room, it turns out that he really is hiding something - his homosexuality. Xander unwittingly helps Larry out of the closet. Larry is then left with the false impression that Xander is also gay, as Xander tells him he's "been there," referring to his brief stint as a hyena. Back in the library, Buffy suggests to Willow that she might have to make the first move if she wants to speed things up with Oz.

While Willow is waiting for Oz and Devon to return to the van outside The Bronze, Harmony approaches her. The two of them talk and then Harmony reveals she's a vampire and bites Willow. Oz rescues her and Harmony goes away, threatening that her boyfriend is not going to be happy that they were mean to her. Buffy and Parker walk back to the dorm, and Parker discovers her scar from when Angel bit her. She tells him it was an angry puppy that bit her. He then asks her to a party the next night and she accepts.

That evening, as Buffy enters the library, she hears Giles telling Angel what he's learned. Angel refuses to believe what Giles is telling him but Giles insists that he's verified the prophecy which tells, without a doubt, that the next evening Buffy will face the Master and die. Buffy is understandably devastated at the idea of her impending death, and rejects Giles and Angel's attempts to comfort her and in a fit of emotion throws the books across the library. She then tells the two that she has a way around the prophecy, by quitting as the Slayer. Even though the two warn her that without her to stop him the Master will rise and unleash hell on earth, she refuses to listen and leaves the cross Angel gave her on the table. She goes back home and tries to convince her mother that they go away for the weekend. Instead, Joyce tells her that the gallery is open on weekends, and then gives her a stunning white prom dress.

After some research, Giles finds out that a werewolf is a wolf for three nights - the coming night, the full moon, would be the second. Since the werewolf is human the rest of the month, it would be wrong to kill him. This, however, is not what werewolf hunter Cain thinks, whom Buffy and Giles meet while looking for the animal in the woods near Lovers' Lane. Cain is out for his twelfth pelt. Though the two groups do not get along, mainly because Cain is a rampant chauvinist, Giles and Buffy do learn that the werewolf will be attracted to places where teenagers hang out - it is the "sexual heat" that draws it.

As their lips meet in a passionate kiss, the lights dim and the rest of the class vanishes. All that Buffy can hear now is the voice of a young girl in the hallway outside, methodically chanting an eerie nursery rhyme about not saying a word, needing seven of something, and a group called the Gentlemen. As Buffy and Riley walk out the door, they see the girl standing at the far end of the hallway, carrying a small box in her hands. When Buffy turns around, she sees a tall, gray-skinned man wearing a suit and a devilish smile. Startled out of her slumber, Buffy heads out of class with Willow. Riley meets up with Buffy, while Willow takes off for her Wicca group meeting. Outside, after coming up with fake plans for their evening, Buffy and Riley move in for their first kiss.

He informs Buffy that unfortunately, she's the only one strong enough to actually stand a chance of winning against the First.

Back at the house, Joyce berates Buffy for bringing Dawn to a murder scene, and  accuses her of wanting to dump Dawn off so that she can go out with Riley. Buffy reminds her that she and Riley are going to patrol, not party. Dawn protests against needing a babysitter until she hears Joyce and Buffy agree on letting Xander babysit. As Joyce leaves, a dressed-up Dawn answers the door for Xander, who comes bearing pizza. Just as a smitten Dawn is about to close the door, Anya bursts in with a bunch of board games. Out on patrol, Buffy rants to Riley about how Joyce expects her to coddle Dawn. Riley comments that Buffy seems to be a little too hard on Dawn. Meanwhile, Dawn does some ranting of her own to Xander and Anya, when a brick crashes through the living room window. Attached is a note that reads "Slayer, come out and die." Xander quietly peers out the front door and sees Harmony and her gang. He mockingly informs her that Buffy is not home and she and her buddies will have to come back later to be killed by Buffy. Harmony reaches for Xander, and realizes too late that she has not been invited in. Frustrated, Harmony begins a war of insults that draws Dawn in, trying to defend her precious Xander.  Without thinking, Dawn yells out for Harmony to come inside so Xander can kick her butt. Anya tries to stop Dawn from interfering, but it's too late. Harmony storms in and knocks Xander to the floor.

Buffy calls a Scooby meeting at Giles' place, where she expresses doubts about Jonathan. She does not know how he starred in The Matrix without ever leaving Sunnydale, or how he graduated from medical school when he's only 18 ("...effective time management," Xander proclaims). She asks the group if Jonathan might be too perfect, but none of them can see her point. Even Riley thinks her ideas sound like nonsense, but "having learned to trust her," he encourages everyone to follow her lead, in spite of the Scooby's lack of trust in her abilities. They look at Giles' copy of Jonathan's swimsuit calendar to see the monster's mark on his shoulder. Jonathan arrives and explains that he does have a history with the monster, and becomes confused every time he faces it. He says that he had the monster's mark tattooed on him so that he "would not underestimate it next time."  Buffy suggests that the two of them go after the monster. Jonathan says it has probably left town, but agrees to try to find it with her. While searching a cemetery, Jonathan and Buffy meet Spike. Buffy threatens Spike, telling him that the butchers in town respect Jonathan, and Spike might be extra thirsty for blood if he doesn't give them some information. Spike tells them several vampires have been kicked out of a cave by something "probably pretty big."

The Woman says that    is up to Buffy. "This is a powerful weapon, but you already have weapons."    the woman tells Buffy. The woman says that Buffy should use the weapon to drive    back the coming evil... "One way or another, it can only mean an end, is    truly near..."

Warren lies to Buffy, telling her that he is going to reverse the mechanism into making her visible. But Willow points out that he's put it on a setting that is going to kill her. Warren knocks her to the ground and aims the gun at Buffy, telling her that she can't see them. However, what he didn't count on was Buffy's Slayer training and experience, providing her with some ability to sense the invisible villains. A scuffle ensues. Warren ends up in the ball-pit, Andrew ends up in the pinball machine, and Buffy ends up holding Jonathan. Willow, who has changed the frequency, aims at Buffy, Jonathan, Andrew, and Warren, making all four visible again.   "So, you three have what? Banded together to be pains in my ass?" Buffy asks.

He tells her how much he loves her in spite of everything she's done. Willow lashes out           at Xander again and again, but his devotion eventually breaks down her barriers.           Collapsing in tears of anguish, Willow falls into Xander's arms, her hair and eyes           returning to their normal color. It's over.

"That was cool." Xander agrees, smiling, but then quickly  gets tough, having spotted his geekyness. "This way" he says as he pushes Andrew  forward. Dawn and Buffy walk behind with Buffy still carrying a shovel. Dawn  asks Buffy what now, with Spike being taken by the First. Buffy starts to  explain but then, turning a corner, they bump into Principal Wood, who also  carries a shovel. Wood nervously says he thought Buffy was sick, but Dawn goes  into a over-informational description of how sick Buffy was, and saying with the  help of some pills, Buffy's better. Buffy then notices the shovel in Wood's  hand, which he explains away as someone having left it in the courtyard. Wood  notices the shovel in Buffy's hand, which she quick-thinkingly passes off as  helping Dawn with a school project, burying a time capsule. "Hello people of the  future, kids today like Red Bull and Jackass!" Dawn remarks nervously. Buffy and  Dawn turn to go, but Wood holds them up, hoping that Buffy will be back to work  soon, as he's got a bit of a backup with kids wanting to talk to her. Buffy  assures him she'll be there, she's all better. Both parties turn to leave, and  Buffy looks suspiciously over her shoulder, the same as Wood does.

Graduation Day has finally arrived, and everybody has a different perspective on it.  Cordelia's concerned about the color of their graduation gowns, Buffy doesn't quite get the whole graduation deal, and Xander, who woke up with a bad feeling in his gut, fears he won't survive Graduation Day.  He's found out that Mayor Wilkins will be their commencement speaker.

Through research, the gang finds that the creature is a Queller demon, and that it is periodically summoned to rid the world of plagues of crazy people. At the Summers' home, Buffy and Dawn put their mother, whose mental clarity continues to deteriorate, to bed. Dawn listens from her bedroom as Joyce babbles loudly. At first, she appears to be talking to the ceiling; however, it is soon revealed that she is talking to the Queller demon, which is watching her from the ceiling. Dawn tries to ignore the babble, and Buffy, who is downstairs washing dishes, turns on loud music and begins to sob. In Joyce's room, the demon falls from the ceiling and spits a thick layer of slime onto Joyce's face. Dawn hears the commotion and runs to check on her mother. When she sees the demon attacking her mother, she comes to the rescue, knocking it onto the floor with a coat rack. It flees from the room, and Dawn slams all the doors and screams for Buffy. Buffy runs upstairs to check on her mother and sister. They tell her about the demon, and she chases it downstairs where she finds Spike coming out of her basement. He asks her if she heard a noise, and she notices that he has been stealing pictures of her, but the demon attacks before she has a chance to berate him. Together, they fight off the demon, and Buffy ultimately kills it with a butcher knife while wrestling with it on the floor. Spike walks over and offers his hand to help her up. He pulls her to her feet, and their hands remain connected as Riley bursts through the door with the soldiers. Spike informed Riley that he had missed quite a show, making sure that Riley understood that Spike had been there to help.

Luckily, Willow's power is           soon tapped out, and the group           escapes to the Magic Box. Once there, they realize Willow has absorbed all the power           from the books in the shop, with the exception of one ancient (and untranslated)           Sumerian book of protection spells. It's their last chance against Willow, whom Buffy           suspects is out looking for a new power source.

Nighttime and a girl runs through a forest with three Bringers    in pursuit. She comes upon a road and at just that moment a pickup truck happens    along. She waves it down and jumps in to find the driver, a young, very confused    preacher, asking what's wrong. She tells him to just drive. As they speed off,    the Bringers chase but can't catch up. The Preacher, speaking in a southern    accent, is startled at first, then chats awkwardly, trying to calm the girl    down. He looks behind the truck and asks the girl if she got involved with devil    worshippers. He then asks if she needs to go anywhere, and she says Sunnydale.    He says he's headed that way too. The two introduce themselves as Shannon and    Caleb. Caleb asks Shannon why those guys were chasing her, which she is unsure    why. "Well, did you ever think that maybe they were chasing you because    you're a whore?" Caleb asks calmly. Shannon starts to grow suspicous as    Caleb continues his condoning preaching, saying that she was born dirty, which    isn't her fault, but she is still dirty. He calmly pushes the truck's cigarrette    lighter in while talking as she struggles to find the door handle, which is    convinently missing. He points out the broken door, then says that she might    not want to get out at that speed, especially with his "boys" behind    them. Shannon then tries to grab the steering wheel, but Caleb effortlessly    pushes her back into her seat.

In another bedroom Giles examines the scythe with Willow    as Buffy tells them that all she knows is that it made Caleb back off quickly.    "So it's true... scythe matters" Willow quips. Giles verbally ignores    the quip. Giles takes the scythe in his hands and does some thrusting and slashing    motions, noticing the weapon's elegance, as Willow remembers Buffy saying she    felt "something"? Buffy says that when she held it she sensed it was    powerful, and that it somehow just "belonged" to her. Willow suggests    it's some sort of traditional Slayer weapon, which makes Giles wonder how something    like that could exist and he not have ever heard anything about it? "The    good guys are not traditionally known for their communication skills" Buffy    says with a hint of emotion. Giles nods his head in agreement, then continues    to ask about the weapon, wondering if it could be used for anything else other    than killing. Buffy says she senses it's not just a tool, it's a weapon, and    she wants to know all about it. Giles and Willow say they'll start researching    right away and won't let her down. Buffy says that the scythe is the only thing    they got going for them.

"Do you know why you're alive?" MorphyDru addresses Spike,  but now her tone is drop dead serious, no wavering or crazy ramblings. "you're  alive for one reason, and for one reason only. Because I wish it." MorphyDru  looks down on a badly beaten yet snarky Spike, who says he's through being a  puppet for whatever she is. "And what makes you think you have a choice? What  makes you think you will ever be any good at all in this world?" MorphyDru says,  quite agitated.

Spike asks how they are to get it in his brain, which brings    Willow forward with a spellbook. She starts an incantation and after a few words,    the stone turns into a liquid blob, wriggling in the box that Giles holds. "oh,    you have GOT to be joking!" Spike freaks at the sight of the gooey former-rock    and asks what next? Giles tells him it has to enter through his optic nerve.    He holds the box up to Spike's eye and the squiggling mass slowly crawls onto    his cheek, and then up under the eyelid. Spike seems a little squicked, but    doesn't complain much until after a few moments, when he grips his head and    howls in pain. Buffy rushes to Spike's side and asks if he's alright. After    the pain subsides, he says he's fine, then asks "How am I supposed to know    if this bugger is doing it's..." He trails off as the room starts to get    light.

Buffy limps desperately into a factory as the UberVamp walks  after her, snarling all the way. He follows her in and out of machinery  (printing presses or something?) and she is limping the entire way. Turning a  corner, he loses her momentarily. She pops up behind and hits UberVamp with a  pipe, but it barely affects him. He starts throwing punches and kicks, leveling  Buffy, really letting her have it. He sends her flying a small distance away  then approaches. Buffy notices a dangling pallets of heavy pipes above the  UberVamp and hits a release lever next to her. The pallet falls and WHAM,  flattens the UberVamp! Buffy gets up and starts to limp away, panicked, but then  she hears noise behind her. The UberVamp rises from amongst the pipes,  unscathed! He jumps to the pursuit as Buffy takes off and he quickly catches up  to her in an outside area again. He grabs her and throws her into a wall,  punches her, kicks her, once again beating the crap out of her, then he sends  her flying into and THROUGH a cynderblock wall! Dust and debris cover her slowly  as the image goes black.

When Giles finds Jenny staying late at the school, she quickly clears her computer screen before he can see that her "special project" is the translation program for the Ritual of Restoration to bring back Angel's soul. Slightly smug, Jenny tells Giles what Buffy said to her earlier that day. Embarrassed but unable to deny it, Giles deems Buffy a "meddlesome girl." When Jenny explains she needs to work a little while longer, but that she may have good news later, Giles warmly invites her over to his place after she's finished. After sunset, Drusilla (still carrying the puppy, Sunshine) pays a visit to the shopkeeper to ask what he and "the mean teacher talked about."

Kennedy walks alone down an alley until a Bringer steps out of the shadows and tries to attack her. The Bringer is ambushed by the rest of the Scooby gang and taken as a captive. Back at the house, they find that the Bringer is without a tongue. Dawn suggests a spell she read about in an old Turkish text that would allow them to communicate with the Bringer.

They ended up arguing over their relationship, or lack thereof (along with Angel's inability to express his jealousy of Xander because Buffy danced suggestively with him in the previous episode), and Angel decided to leave.

The next morning Buffy is behaving in a somewhat unstable manner. She blows her chance at the cheerleading squad when she tosses the head cheerleader, Joy, through the room, ceding her place to Amy. Buffy turns out to have something more than just a mood disorder: a bloodstone vengeance spell has destroyed her immune system, giving her only about three hours to live. The only way to cure her and break the other spells is to get the witch's spell book and reverse the magic. The ailing Buffy and Giles confront Amy's mother, Catherine, and find out that Catherine switched bodies with her daughter months before, saying that Amy was wasting her youth, so she took it for herself. Giles finds the witch's book and takes Amy and Buffy back to the school to break the spells.

Amanda tells Dawn the Vampire's trapped upstairs, then asks    if Dawn is ok? Dawn says she's fine, but it's obvious she's very jumpy and nervous.    Amanda asks if the scratch will turn her into a Vampire, but Dawn says no and    tells her why (must drink of a vampire, yada yada). Amanda wonderis if they    really have to kill the vampire, thinking instead of letting it loose in the    gym so it can take out the marching band who look down on Swing Choir.

The next day, Buffy asks Willow if she'd like to go out that night, but her experience with her vampire double has made her "feel like staying in, and doing homework, and flossing, and dying a virgin," in order to make up for the "double guilt coupons" Vampire Willow has accumulated. But then, Percy shows up, and before Willow can apologize for not doing his work, he starts treating her with great respect. He presents her with papers on both President Franklin Delano Roosevelt and President Theodore Roosevelt: he wasn't sure which one the report was supposed to be on, and he didn't feel like risking Willow's wrath again. He's even prepared a bibliography and shyly presents her with an apple. Willow, now seeing that perhaps there's something to be said for a little vice, agrees to go out for the evening.

When they return home, Xander tells Buffy about Harmony and - after the Slayer stops laughing - she gets angry that Dawn invited Harmony inside, even though it was purely unintentional.

Before Anya can bring Dawn back inside, Harmony's vampire minions capture Dawn and attack Anya. Buffy then runs out to find her sister, leaving Xander and Riley to take care of Anya, who requires hospitalization.

In the background is a Chaos Demon, with huge slimy antlers, with whom Drusilla had been shamelessly flirting.

As Buffy and Willow leave, Giles tells Xander that none of the research he did into animal possession mentioned memory loss... he knows that Xander (who is still unable to believe everything he did) remembers everything that happened but promises to not tell anyone.

Buffy and Xander knock at the room where the latest Potential is staying. When no one answers, Buffy kicks the door in and they find a dead blond girl lying on the ground. Upon closer inspection, they find that the girl is Eve and she's been dead for days. Back at the house, Andrew talks to Dawn about his usefulness and continues to ramble, even after Dawn informs him that Buffy gave her permission to kill him. Buffy and Xander return to the house and proceed towards the basement where they tell "Eve" to get away from the others. The First in Eve's form finally reveals itself and with some thanks for all the information over the past few days and threatening comments about the future, then disappears. In the other dimension, Giles and Anya speak with the Beljoxa's Eye, which tells them that the First Evil cannot be destroyed and that it exists now because of a disruption in the Slayer's line, which was in fact, caused by the Slayer.

The next day, the gang helps Xander move out of his basement, as Anya reads a magazine, refusing to help. Xander brings her a box, which she reluctantly brings to the truck, leaving Xander alone with Riley. Xander tells Riley that he envies how stable his and Buffy's relationship is in contrast to his own turbulent relationship with Anya. Riley replies that he feels very lucky to have Buffy but shocks Xander when he says that Buffy doesn't love him back. Buffy walks in before an astonished Xander can respond, and gives Riley a kiss.

Buffy tells Giles of Xander's change in behavior, clothing, treatment to others and his new friends. Giles, however, brushes it off as normal teenage male behavior caused by testosterone, saying he is likely to "prey on the weak". This phrase takes Buffy back to her conversation with the zookeeper and so she believes his change is the result of their trip to the zoo. Giles still doesn't believe her claim of it being supernatural which would make him "look stuff up". This changes when Willow arrives and tells them the pack has eaten Herbert, prompting Giles to "look stuff up".

Down in the basement of the Summers home, Xander is locking    Spike's manacles as he complains to himself that the chains weren't there a    week ago, only when Spike needs them. Spike sits on his cot, chained to the    wall, as Dawn, Buffy, and Robin stand by watching him. Spike asks what Robin's    doing there, wondering if he wants to see a show. Robin says it's moral support    (but his glare says otherwise). "Whattya gonna do, some hypno beam or disarming    spell?" Spike questions as Giles walks up and says that the First has him    brainwashed and it triggers something violent within him, so they're going to    put something in his brain. Giles produces a small box with a shiny, brown blob    of a stone inside. "Bugger that!" Spike objects, but Giles says that    the "Prokaryote" stone will go through his mind to reveal the root    of the trigger's power, then they'll be able to break it's hold on Spike.

Buffy appears at the bottom of the stairs, awkwardly observing    that they seem to be getting along. Faith is smiling, and Spike simply asks    why Buffy isn't at work.

Marching into his apartment, Xander lays out the ground rules for living in his house as Buffy and Dawn walk in behind him. He turns to an exasperated, uninvited Spike, who's standing at the doorway. Xander then reluctantly, halfheartedly invites him in, and it is revealed that Buffy has insisted that Spike needs to leave the basement of Sunnydale High because of his deteriorating mental state, and he has to stay with Xander, at least for the short term, because he has nowhere else to go, a plan that Xander makes no effort to hide his disgust with. Buffy is certain that the events that occurred between the two in "Seeing Red" will not repeat themselves, now that Spike has a soul, though Xander and Dawn remain somewhat skeptical, and Buffy even briefly recoils in shock when Spike grabs her arm while trying to talk to her. Though both Spike and Xander are certain that the arrangement will not work, Buffy is certain that it already is working because, aside from one episode, Spike has "stopped talking to invisible people".

Buffy shows up at Warren's in search of answers relating to April, while Katrina finally walks out, upset about being kept in the dark. Warren reveals to Buffy that he made April to be the perfect girlfriend, however rather than falling in love with her as expected, he instead grew bored with how predictable and easy things were with her. He then met and fell in love with Katrina, and, instead of "breaking up" with April, cowardly left her in his dorm room to let her batteries run down. Buffy asks if Katrina is dangerous, and Warren tells her that she's only programmed to be in love with him... Which confirms to Buffy she is dangerous.

Unfortunately, Buffy screams and the demon gang begins chasing her. Suddenly, Buffy comes face-to-face with Xander, Willow, Anya and Tara. At first they think that the Slayer is the Buffybot, but quickly realize that she is the real McCoy.

Robin unlocks a padlock to his garage or "workroom"    as he calls it as Spike says it's nice that he has a place to let loose in.    They enter the darkened garage but then the lights come up and Spike looks at    dozens of wooden crosses surrounding him on the walls. "What the bloody    hell is this?" Robin says it's his sanctuary and says he's just being careful    because it's the hellmouth. He then walks over to a computer that sits in the    corner (a Macintosh that makes PC sounds) and starts typing in some info as    Spike asks Robin what his "deal" is. Robin says there is no story,    he's just trying to do what is right and make a difference. There is obvious    tension in the air as Robin starts to take off his shirt and don some studded    gloves, talking to Spike, saying that he's been searching for Spike for a long    time, ever since he killed Robin's mother. Spike looks concerned/suspicous as    he says that he's killed a lot of people's mothers. Robin says that Spike would    remember his, because she was a Slayer. Light dawns on Spike as he says "so    that's it, you brought me here to kill me?" "No, I want to kill the    monster who took my mother away from me" Robin says coldly. Robin then    turns and clicks the mouse on the computer. Suddenly the room is filled with    the song Early One Morning and Spike starts to look around, paniced    and confused. Robin looks on coldly as Spike struggles for control, but then    the song overtakes him and Spike vamps out. "Oh, there he is." Robin    says.

Episode Synopsis by: Michelle Albuquerque
|
Angel answers a knock at his door to find a distraught Buffy wanting to see with her own eyes that he's all right. Hearing that she dreamed Drusilla was still alive and killed him "right in front of her," Angel tries to comfort Buffy, to reason with her, but when her anxiety only seems to escalate, he simply kisses her. Totally diverted, Buffy melts into his arms and their embrace deepens until the Slayer reluctantly pulls away, saying she needs to get to school. Caught himself, Angel agrees she must, then catches her and kisses her again. Feigning resolve, Buffy moves toward the door while Angel stalks her, corners her, and kisses her yet again. At the neck-kissing stage, Angel comes to his senses a little. Struggling for control, he reminds Buffy to tell him what she'd like for a gift. After a moment, she says "Surprise me." Angel gives her a crooked little smile, murmurs "Okay, I will," and gently kisses her one last time. Buffy sighs and confesses that it's becoming harder to say goodbye, no matter whose bedtime it is. Staring intently into her eyes, Angel agrees.
|
Overnight, Buffy dreams that she is walking around the Sunnydale High campus.  Nobody else is there, except for Angel.  She then wakes up and heads to the kitchen.  The stray cat reenters the Summers home, shocking both Buffy and Joyce.  Giles arrives shortly with a cage to capture the cat and bring it back to the library for further study.  After finding the cat in Joyce's bedroom, he notices the Nigerian mask on her wall.  He then informs Buffy that she is no longer allowed on school grounds.  At the library, Giles studies his demonology text while the rest of the Slayerettes make plans for the dinner that evening.  By the end of their discussion, the intimate dinner has become a full-blown party, complete with pot luck snacks and Oz's band.  During the discussion, Giles careless flips past a page without looking at it.  On this page is a picture of the same mask hanging in Joyce's bedroom.
|
After a wild round of sex on the bottom floor of Spike's crypt, Buffy and Spike carry on a real conversation about decorating and Buffy's feelings for Spike. Spike asks Buffy if she even likes him, to which she replies, "Sometimes." Pulling out a pair of handcuffs, Spike then asks Buffy if she trusts him to which she replies, "Never."
|
Xander rushes into the bathroom, almost falling into the hole in the floor. "Oh! Contracty goodness!" he smiles, but then goes hunting for the talisman.

After unpacking the last of her belongings, Buffy stops by her mom's bedroom to announce that she's heading outside.  Joyce hangs up a Nigerian mask that she got from a friend at her art gallery, then hesitantly gives her daughter permission to go find her friends.  Later, in a dark alley, Buffy notices a shadowy figure roaming the alleys.  Suspicious, she follows him and accidentally draws his attention by stepping on an aluminum can. The figure spins around and thrusts a stake at her, which Buffy easily blocks.  As she grabs the stake out of the man's hands and turns it towards him, she realizes that it's Xander.  Before either of them can say much, a vampire appears and attacks the both of them.  During the struggle, Buffy hears Cordelia's voice on a walkie-talkie attached to Xander's waist. Soon enough, Cordy, Willow, and Oz arrive on the scene, all decked out with stakes and crosses.  Buffy is surprised to see her friends work as a team to get the vampire off of Buffy.  One by one, though, they are knocked to the ground by the powerful vampire.  Finally, Buffy jumps in and finishes the job, reducing the vampire to a pile of dust.  After Buffy greets her bewildered friends, they head over to Giles' apartment.  The Watcher is emotionally overcome with joy from seeing his Slayer safe and sound, although he doesn't fully express it until he's alone in his kitchen.  In the living room, Buffy avoids discussion topics relating to what she did over the summer.  She then makes plans with Willow to meet somewhere the next afternoon.

While talking to Xander, Willow sarcastically mentions Buffy and Spike getting married, and then at Giles's place, Spike proposes to Buffy and she accepts.
|
Riley takes Dawn to the park, where he tries to comfort her about her mother. Dawn tries to make Riley feel good by positively comparing him to Buffy's former boyfriend Angel, but unintentionally makes him feel worse: she relates that she thinks Riley is good for Buffy because Buffy was always in tears over her tumultuous relationship with Angel, but that she never cries over Riley - she never "gets that worked up" over him. The impact of this revelation is evident in his face - this is yet another way that he can see that Buffy has kept him at an emotional distance and that she feels no intensity in their relationship.
|
At the same time, in a van on the way to Sunnydale, a man stands up and begins to lecture the other passengers on God's judgment, quoting prophecies. Suddenly, a vampire walks in front of the bus, causing it to crash. Other vampires swarm the wreck, attacking the passengers, including the religious man.

Glory orders her minions to watch the Slayer and see who is new and special in her life, as that person is likely to be the Key. That night, one of the minions watches the gang through a window; Dawn secretly takes Anya's earrings from a table.  Spike receives his Buffybot from Warren who quickly leaves town. Spike and his Buffybot pretend to fight, which inevitably leads to sex. While Spike is sleeping it off, the Buffybot heads out to patrol for vampires. She runs into Xander and Anya in a graveyard and they believe her to be Buffy, but are puzzled because she is acting strangely-she didn't even ask about Dawn. Turning back to make sure Buffy is OK, Xander and Anya witness Spike and the Buffybot having sex in the cemetery. Xander and Anya are shocked and they go to Willow's place to tell her what they saw. Unbeknownst to them, Glory's minions also witness Spike and Buffy, and they conclude that Spike is the Key, and they rush back to tell Glory. At Willow's place, all are horrified and disturbed by Buffy's behavior, and Xander goes back to confront Spike. Spike has the Buffybot hide in the crypt from Xander. He tells Spike that he's taking advantage of Buffy during a difficult time. While they argue, Glory's minions show up, knock Xander unconscious, and take Spike (they don't see the Buffybot). Glory is upset when she sees Spike, as she knows a vampire cannot be the Key. The minions insist that they saw Buffy protecting him ahead of the others, and Glory reasons that Spike may know something so decides to torture the information out of him.

Tempers run hot when the gang learns of Angel's  return and Buffy's  harboring this vicious killer, but they all must band together to fight a demon who has arrived in Sunnydale in search of a highly powerful weapon.

In class, Anya tries to entice Xander into another date, but is stunned when she finds out about the upcoming Ascension. Xander brings her to the library, where she tells of an Ascension she witnessed 800 years before in the Koskov Valley above the Urals. A sorcerer became the embodiment of the demon Lohesh a four-winged soul killer, and decimated an entire village within hours; only a few people escaped. Anya explains that an Ascension means that a human being becomes pure demon. She tells them that all the demons that walk the earth are tainted-human hybrids like vampires, but that a pure demon is different. She doesn't think this sounds like Lohesh, though, because the rituals are all different.

The two run up to Buffy's room and barricade themselves inside. Angelus comes and pulls Xander out through Buffy's open window with the intention to kill him as a Valentine's Day gift for Buffy. Just before he's able to, however, Angelus is blindsided. Xander initially thinks Buffy has arrived, but his savior is actually Drusilla, who has also fallen under the love spell.

Before she sires Xander, the two are besieged by the mob of women and separated. Willow is about to cut Xander's head off, but is stopped by Cordelia.

The next day, Willow is teaching a class, and as she is walking around checking people's work on their computers, she sees Gage playing solitaire on his computer. She tells him off, but he doesn't seem to care. After class, Principal Snyder tells Willow that they're still unable to find a replacement for Ms. Calendar, so she'll have to continue substituting for the time being. Willow informs Snyder that Gage is failing because he doesn't show up for tests or do homework. Snyder is not interested; he tells her that, as Gage a member of the swim team, he's under much more pressure than the rest of the students, and demands that she change Gage's grade from an F to a D. Buffy comes to school with Cameron, and he tries to grope her. She hits his head against the steering wheel and breaks his nose.

Giles comes into the kitchen, he says he's done with the Bringer, the Bringer's dumb. Anya asks him if he expected a world scholar. Giles explains he meant the Bringer was deaf and mute. Dawn says she was reading a Turkish spell book, there was something about a spell used to communicate with the recently deceased, she wonders if that could help. Willow says she's read a translation of that spell book. Dawn says "There's a translation!" and is pissed off for a second before she says she's over it. Andrew's voice rings out as he hollers that they're home. He and Spike walk into the kitchen. Spike wonders where Buffy is. Willow says Buffy decided to leave. Spike gets angry, he calls them all ungrateful traitors. Now that she's surpassed Giles' knowledge, Giles is all jealous of it or something. Buffy's died for them and how do they pay her back. Faith tells him to shut up, the time for speech giving is over. Spike punches Faith in the face. Faith gets up, tells him he's sweet on her, Faith hits him, tells him he's pretty whipped. They fight, Faith knocks Spike into the livingroom. Spike says she's finally gotten what she's always wanted. He asks where Buffy is, Faith says she doesn't know. Spike storms out the door.

As she pauses to give orders, Buffy is stabbed through her abdomen from behind by a Turok-Han and falls to the ground. She passes the scythe to Faith and asks her to hold the line. As she lies on the ground, she sees several Slayers fall, including Amanda. In the halls of the school, a few Turok-Han make it to the surface and attack the group guarding the entrances. A small group of Bringers also appear and attack. During the battle, Anya is bisected by a Bringer. 
Andrew fights until he is overwhelmed. Principal Wood is stabbed by a Bringer who is then killed by Giles. Xander and Dawn take on some Turok-Han who are disintegrated by sunlight when Dawn throws open a skylight window, but more follow. In the Hellmouth, the First then appears to Buffy as a mortally wounded Buffy herself, saying "What more do you want?". Ordering The First to "get out of my face!" Buffy arises with renewed determination and knocks several Turok-Han off the ledge. Other Slayers are reinvigorated as well. Just then, Spike's amulet consumes him in blue light and blasts a hole upward into the sky.

However, he slows his pace when he sees that she is crying. Her pain stays his hand, his demeanor softens, and all his plans to shoot her are abandoned. He asks her what is wrong, and how he can help. She is surprised and confused at his reaction, and has no response, so he sets the gun down and takes a seat next to her on the porch.

IF she should    make it through all of this mess, then someday maybe she'll be cookies. "And    then, you know, if I want someone to eat me... er... enjoy warm, delicious cookie    me, that's fine, that will be then, when I'm done." Angel understands and    starts to talk, thinking about what to say, but doesn't want to continue with    the awkward cookie analogy. Buffy says she doesn't want to think that far ahead,    about a future with anyone. He then slips the amulet into Buffy's hand as he    slowly turns to leave, saying "I'd better get working on the second front...    make sure I don't have to use it." As he's walking away, Buffy calls out    to him, haulting him for just a second. "I do... sometimes... think that    far ahead." She tells her first love.

Inside the church, the vampires that Adam took under his wing are the ones tormenting the frightened Sunnydale locals.  When Faith shows up outside, she runs into Riley who still thinks she is Buffy.  When she tells him she wants to go inside and do some slaying, Riley tries to stop her from entering alone.  Faith shrugs him off and goes in anyway, driven by some force to help the innocent people inside.  She takes on Adam's followers in a grueling fight that rumbles throughout the church.  After slaying three of them she is pinned down by the leader.  Out of nowhere, Buffy stakes him from behind.  But rather than thanking her, Faith attacks Buffy.

She knew Dawn would die & something awful would happen, but, Buffy's life, her fight would be over & Buffy was tired of fighting. Buffy says that that is why she killed Dawn.

Then, Willow says that she's going where Buffy's needed & asks if Buffy's coming. Buffy wakes & cries. Later, she goes back to the magic shop. Giles has found a text that explains the ritual. He knows that Glory plans to open the dimensional portals by bleeding Dawn. & the only way to stop it once it starts is to stop Dawn's blood from flowing. & the only way to do that is to kill Dawn.

Buffy smashes a window so that extra light pours into the room, and Luke is momentarily stunned because he thinks it is daylight, allowing Buffy to stake him and so prevent The Master from rising.

Buffy smiles as Giles    wonders who he can talk to about the situation. Robin says "that would    be me" and introduces himself.

Giles says he's relieved to have another ally,    as they're running short on them. Buffy questions if things are still bad, which    Giles relates that the Seers in the coven are still detecting that the First    is still gathering power and that war is inevitable.

New York, 1977 - Spike tells Buffy how he killed the second Slayer (Nikki Wood). Spike and Buffy fight out a play-by-play of the battle, which took place on a subway train. Spike notes that this second Slayer was not all business like the first - she had an improvisational style more closely resembling Buffy's. After he snapped the Slayer's neck, he took her black leather coat for himself. Spike then explains that the key to his victories was not in the particular moves or blows; the key was that each Slayer has a death wish, a desire to experience death, after causing so much of it, additionally claiming that Buffy also has this wish, but has ties to the world that keep her anchored. They want to know what comes next because they wish for a final peace after a lifetime of being solely responsible for protecting the world from demons. Spike explains that the second that that desire takes over, the Slayer will die because there are countless vampires just waiting to take advantage of this, a conclusion that Buffy immediately rejects.

In the library, Cordelia sketches the creature that Xander saw before running off "like a woman." Buffy and Willow return, having been informed that Cameron and Dodd were the two best swimmers on the team; Gage being the third best. Buffy is assigned to shadowing Gage - suspecting that he will be attacked next - while Willow interrogates Jonathan under a lamp. According to Jonathan, he indeed wanted revenge, but achieved it in a very different way: by peeing in the pool before practice one morning. Xander, who has been teased for his cowardice by Cordelia, overhears Marin and Snyder chatting. They need another swimmer, or they won't be eligible for competition; they don't even care if the guy can swim a stroke, so long as he shows up for practice. The next day, Gage grows suspicious of Buffy when she follows him around. At the Bronze that night, Buffy is confronted by Gage; she attempts to cover it up, but fails. She tells him that his life is in danger, but he doesn't believe her and calls her a "psycho bitch" and a "head tripper". He leaves, only to encounter Angelus in the parking lot. They complain briefly about Buffy, then Angelus turns into his "vamp face" and bites him, intending to "turn" Gage and recruit him for his war against Buffy. However, seconds later, Angelus stops and spits the blood out. Buffy comes to Gage's rescue. A now-fearful Gage lets Buffy walk him home, while Buffy wonders why Angel spit the blood out.

Willow says they're stuck, not finding any information on  the First, no documentation of any sort. Giles says that's because it pre-dates  the written word. The only info to be found was in the Council library. Anya  asks what the Counsel has to say about all of this. Giles gets a pained look on  his face. "Gone. Obliterated. They were in session and there was an explosion."  Willow asks about all the counsels records, to which Giles looks at one of the  SIT's, calling Annabelle's name. Annabelle (a British red-head, hair like Dawns,  average looking) pulls open a backpack and produces two books and some files,  laying them on the table.

Giles admits that when he learned what was going on, he  stole the files. Anya looks shocked "and you blew up the counsel! See, this is  what happens when you get all stuffy and repressed! You overreact." Giles  corrects her, saying that it probably was an agent of the First that set the  explosion after his little burglary session. He explains he had to protect the  knowledge in the files, with no time for beauacracy or debate with the Counsel.  "And it cost them their lives!"

Spike rushes in from behind her with a long metal pole and whaps the worm, saying "you've had your turn, love. Leave the real battles to the demons, yes? That's right, big bad's back, and looking for a little death!" Spike takes the pole and holds it like a spear, then lunges at the worm. Just then, the worm morphs into a human male, Robby.

In the Initiative lab, Maggie briefs Buffy on a basic reconnaissance mission.  After notifying her of a possible hostile roaming the sewers, Maggie equips Buffy with the com-cam prototype and a taser.  Soon after beginning her mission, Buffy detects the target heading towards her from up ahead.  When two axe-wielding demons step around the corner and confront Buffy, she immediately recognizes them from the Pit at the Initiative laboratory.

With one down and one to go, Buffy disarms her opponent, sending the axe into the nearby water canal. However, the demon strikes back, knocking Buffy to the ground before retrieving his axe.

She looks at the weapon (from here on    out called a "Scythe", yet it is clearly axe-like in it's design)    and is clearly awestruck by it. The large axe blade is a glistening silver with    a deep red inner blade color, the lower end of the blade ends in a pointed hook,    and the opposite end of the scythe handle ends in a wooden stake. Caleb, wondering    what to say, can only comment "darn."

Xander backs off, reminding Buffy    that they are behind her and they're her friends. "I'm not" says Anya,    which makes Buffy turn and question aloud Anya's place and what her job is.    Anyas only answer is that she provides the sarcasm, which Xander says is his    job. Buffy says Anya's there because she's scared, that's all. Buffy says that    they're all scared, but she wants them to be useful at the same time, and starts    another not-quite-so-motivational speech about how the First knows them and    they're not ready to fight it.

Dawn lays on the train tracks, silently sobbing, as the train horn blows, signifying it's getting closer.

The two girls start to argue again as Xander notices Dawn on the train tracks a distance away. Buffy takes off, catching up to a train that is running parallel to her, headed in Dawn's direction on a different track. She grabs onto one of the cars and climbs up on top, riding it towards Dawn, who lays on the track, scared and sobbing. Buffy dives off her train, hits the ground hard, then rushes towards Dawn, who's train is fast approaching on the track that she lays on. Buff runs over and grabs Dawn off the tracks JUST in the train is about to whap them. Buffy yells at Dawn, wondering if that's how she's gonna get RJ's attention, by getting Tri-cected?!? Dawn says she has nothing to compete with. She's not as experienced or sexy or hotter or stronger than Buffy, so the only thing she has to offer is her life, thinking that their love would be true forever. Buffy is upset, and her reason and love for her sister temporarily over-rides the spell, saying that no boy is worth that and that Dawn is scaring her. Dawn thought that Buffy wanted RJ for herself, which Buffy says no... well... yes. "God that boy is hot..." she says, then admits she might be under the spell.

That night on patrol, Buffy and Riley come across a tentacle-headed demon that they make short work of.  Afterwards, Buffy tries to explain to Riley the complications of Willow and Oz's relationship.  When he finds out Oz is a werewolf, he asks why Willow would be stupid enough to fall for someone who tries to eat her once a month.  Buffy is appalled and calls him a bigot for being insensitive to the complications of love.  Meanwhile, Oz shows up at Willow's room.  He brings her outside and points to the sky.  Willow looks up to see a full moon.  She hugs him joyously and asks what he did to change back to a human.  He tells her that he'll explain later, he has something more important to discuss.

In the basement, the SIT's are training: Molly is practicing flipping a stake (slowly), Kennedy holds a punching bag for one of the two yet to be named gals, the other is stretching. Eve asks what they're all doing there with a hint of sarcasm. "Called training. Didn't your Watcher ever teach you the word?" Nora says she never had a Watcher, just having found out what she is when the "crazy ass monks" started coming for her. Eve continues with the gloom and doom talk, wondering what they're going to do. She's never seen a real vampire, let alone slayed one. The SIT who was stretching (hereby known as "hat-wearing SIT" cause she's wearing a knitted rainbow beret) says she saw a vampire, then backtracks and says she saw a picture of a vampire... a blurry picture. Eve says not one of them is remotely ready should any of them be activated as the Slayer. Kennedy says she feels ready. Nora wants clarification by saying that to be activated the Slayer has to die, then one of them is activated. "I prefer called" says Molly. "I heard there's more than one..." says Hat-SIT. Molly says it doesn't make any sense, but Eve keeps up the slightly worried, negative talk, saying that Buffy can't live forever and one of them will be called. They start talking about how they're not prepared, too young (excpet for Kennedy, who thinks she might be too old and it might be too late) as Eve says all they can do is sit around and wait for each other to die.

Dawn then asks if they should round up the gang, but Xander motions around "This is the gang." Buffy re-assures Nancy that everything will be all right.

Giles arrives at his apartment to see one red rose on the front door and strains of opera music drifting from inside. Opening the door, he finds an ice bucket on the desk, complete with chilling champagne and a folded piece of parchment paper bearing one word in flowing script: "Upstairs." Carrying the champagne, Giles follows a path of votive candles and roses to the top of the stairs while the music swells below. He smiles, clearly anticipating a romantic night with Ms. Calendar. At his first glimpse of Jenny on the bed, the music crescendos and the heavy bottle of champagne smashes to the floor. Jenny's staring eyes and lividly striated neck belie the relaxed pose of her limbs. Nearly catatonic with shock and grief, Giles remains silent and motionless until the police officer, following the coroner's people wheeling a laden stretcher, asks him to come in for questioning. Giles abstractedly complies, but asks to make a phone call first.

Buffy swings the battle axe but misses as the really bumpy demon bats her back, forcing Buffy to re-group.

The battle takes place in Anya's apartment during the day, but it quickly ends with Buffy throwing the batttle axe into the demon's chest, killing it. "Good thing I stopped by when I heard screaming" Buffy says as she helps Anya up. "Seems as if D'hoffryn is trying to take you out, eh?" Anya agrees, saying he's not the head of vengence for nothing as she gets some ice and a towel from the freezer, prepping a cold pack. She tells Buffy that she can go now, she doesn't need anyone's help. Then looking around at the mess, she says she DOES need help, but she doesn't want it. Buffy sympathises and says "I don't want my friends out there alone right now, ok?" hinting at the greatt impending doom that is upon them. Anya gets choked up at Buffy's extended "we're still friends" speech and agrees that they can use her help, saying that Willow's tactical skills are bad, except when she's evil, and that Dawn is good for nothing.

Buffy tells Dawn to keep on with    the kit research as the two head out of the bedroom. Buffy asks Dawn if she    has homework.

Buffy raises her sword to attack, but D'hoffryn says not to bother, he'll be gone before she gets close. He then goes on to say he had a talk with Ms. Rosenburg (he has high hopes for her). Seems Willow thinks that Anyanka would be better suited outside of the vengence fold, they know what "Ms. Hacks-a-lot" wants, and Xander only sees things through the eyeballs of love, but no one has asked what Anyanka wants. "Her name is Anya" Xander growls. D'hoffryn corrects him "Funny historical sidebar, actually her name is..."

Buffy takes Willow back to their dorm and then goes to take care of Veruca. Using Oz's heightened senses to lead the way, Buffy and Oz go looking for Veruca, although Buffy is not interested in Oz's explanation for why he committed the actions which have left her best friend heartbroken. They find Veruca's clothes and then come to the conclusion that she left her clothes to throw them off her scent and has gone after Willow. Willow is in one of the campus labs, conjuring a spell that will prove to be devastating revenge against Oz and Veruca. She can't bring herself to complete the spell, however, and Veruca then enters, locking the door with intent to kill Willow when the sun goes down and get her out of the way. Just in time, Oz breaks in and the two werewolves fight until Oz rips Veruca's throat out. Before he can attack Willow, Buffy arrives and tranquilizes him, and then turns to comfort a traumatized and hysterical Willow.

The two, with no indication of wanting to fight or kill one another, begin to reminisce. When Holden asks Buffy why she has a stake and why she was trying to kill him, Buffy tells Holden that it is because she is the Slayer and that it is her job. Holden takes this news surprisingly well, and even says that it also explains her frequent absences at school and why she was often late.

Before school, Jenny goes to a magic shop where she buys an Orb of Thesulah, a spirit-vault for rituals of the undead, from a well-meaning proprietor who recognizes her as Janna.

The Orb glows when she tells the shopkeeper she plans to give a friend his soul back. At school, Willow and Buffy meet up with Xander, who gets a little excited about their slumber party the night before.

You're the one who constructed this elaborate fantasy about you and my lover..." Buffy says. Dawn is upset, saying that Buffy lied to her about RJ's feelings for her and tells Buffy not to do this.

Seizing the opportunity to explain           his actions, he stumbles badly, and Anya interprets all his explanations           negatively. Anya seethes, to the point of bringing out the demon within her           (literally), denouncing Xanders very existence. Once she regains her           composure a bit, she unleashes an impressively vitriolic stream of bad wishes           and curses at him and storms out.

As Buffy comes back to the present, her teacher writes something from the lesson on the board. As he finishes writing, it becomes clear that he has unintentionally written "Don't walk away from me, bitch!" which is a line uttered by the student holding the gun who Buffy stopped.

We are alone!" Buffy replies, "That's it! I'm waking up!" The Slayers fight in the desert and then Buffy wakes up in her living room next to her dying friends. There, the First Slayer attacks her again and repeatedly stabs her with a knife, until Buffy realizes that she can stop the fight mentally if she just rejects the first Slayer and forbids her any power, telling her decisively "You're not the source of me."

Meanwhile, Adam and one of his followers gather information at a house they invaded.  When Adam sees Jonathan on television, he tries to explain to his vampire soldier that reality has been changed.  Everyone is under a spell except himself because his molecular structure is more in tune with the surrounding world than any human, demon or member of the undead.  Across town, when Tara enters her building on her way to bed, she is attacked out of the blue by the same demon that was outside Jonathans house.  She is instantly pinned beneath the howling beast but manages to whip together a spell that shoots dust in its face.  With her attacker distracted for a moment, she bolts out from beneath it and bounds into a janitor's closet.  A few hours later she is found by a student huddled up in shock, and brought to Willow and Buffy's room.  When Buffy comes home, she shows the symbol that Karen drew to the still rattled Tara.  Tara states that it was present on the demon's head that attacked her.  Buffy begins questioning Jonathan's bizarre lack of compliance to help find the creature and calls a meeting at Giles'.  When the gang gets there she explains that it seems impossible that Jonathan has done so many great things, including coaching the US Women's soccer team to an Olympic Gold.  She explains a theory that they could be living in an alternate universe that could be created by a spell like the ones Anya used to create.  She shows them a photo in a Jonathan Swimsuit Calendar in which the same symbol from the demon is displayed on his back in scar tissue.  Suddenly Jonathan walks in and questions their inquisitive glances.  When asked about the scar, Jonathan gives a bizarre explanation that seems to satisfy everyone but Buffy.  Buffy asks Jonathan to go on patrol with her to put the demons reign of terror to an end.

Oz sits in a bathtub, chanting to himself that he isn't going to change. Willow conjures her spell. However, it quickly spins out of control, and she screams for help as it attacks her. Buffy, hearing Willow's cries, tries to get to her, but she falls into the basement where bodies come up from the ground and grab at her. Giles and Anya are unable to find a way inside, so Giles cuts a door using a chainsaw. While fleeing through the house, the gang ends up in the room where the mystical symbol is painted. Giles and Anya break into the room. They determine the sign on the floor to be the Mark of Gachnar, and Buffy and Giles express fear about how scary the demon looks in the illustration. Buffy destroys the symbol before Giles can tell her that destroying the symbol will bring Gachnar forth. But when the demon has manifested, it turns out to be merely a few inches in height. After a laugh at absurdity of giving in to one's fears, Buffy squashes Gachnar with her shoe. At Giles' place, the gang eats candy while Giles makes a discovery: the arcane footnote below the illustration of Gachnar in his book reads "Actual Size" .

Later that evening, Willow and Giles are still doing research    on the blade. Willow has a website up with a few famous historical weapons displayed,    but they still can't find a single thing about it. They talk about how the Vineyard    used to be a Monistary, but Giles says it's older than that, pre-Christian.    Willow says it might have been an earlier Pagan temple. Giles says he has discriptions    of other famous weapons, but he is obviously frustraited by not finding anything    and fears they're running out of time. Willow curiously goes over and picks    the weapon up and concentraits a little on it. Giles asks if she senses anything    like the power Buffy spoke of, but she doesn't. Giles then suggests that magic    might help out with this sort of thing. Willow says it would, but reasons if    Caleb was scared of the Scythe, it's gotta be powerful, and she doesn't want    to risk going "Dark Willow" again. Giles says that she could do it    without risk, but Willow says she can't try it. "I can hardly do a locator    spell without getting dark roots." Willow goes back to the laptop as Giles    concedes and says they'll keep looking. Willow is frustraited that all the weapons    on the webpage "History of the Axe" don't match, and some she can't    even read. She points out an example of a weapon named "m?" Giles    says that the ? isn't a question mark, but is an international symbol for a    gluttelstof (sp?), a sort of gulpy noise in phonetics. He then starts remembering    things about hyroglyphs and mentions that the gluttelstof is often thought to    represent a sickle or a scythe, a symbol that is seen throughout many carvings    and such. Willow suggests it might be found on the pagan temple. Giles then    says that the scythe is a symbol of death, "so lets see where these pagans    buried their dead.

Buffy and Spike walk in, and Spike lights up, getting a    quick second-hand smoke jab from Dawn. Andrew then says it's time to get introductions,    which gets Amanda all excited as she waves into the camera, but Andrew says    not her yet, they've got to start from the top. First, there's Buffy

When Oz runs into Tara later in the halls, he tells her he's coming back to school.  Before Tara can excuse herself, Oz smells Willow on her.  His werewolf instincts tell him instantly that they are emotionally involved in some way.  As Oz gets angry, he suddenly begins to transform into a wolf.  Before it takes his body over completely, he warns her to run.  Tara ducks into an empty lecture hall with Oz in wolf form, hot on her heels.  As he lunges at her something knocks him out of the air.  Riley, Forrest and other members of the Initiative rush in, having just shot Oz with a tranquilizer.  Before Tara can explain to them that it's a human, they haul it back to the base.  Back at the tomb, Adam offers to remove the chip from Spike's head if he helps him get to Buffy.

Buffy, Faith, and Spike walk in the front door of the Summer's    home as Faith comments that everything looks the same. Spike continues down    the hall as Buffy says that everything in the house has been destroyed and replaced,    so it's new-ish. Sitting in the background in the dining room, Dawn slowly rises    and calls Buffy. Giles also rises from the table and both of them glare at Faith    who at first tries to smile her welcome. Dawn's glare could break boards though    and she asks Buffy if Faith has to stay there. "Isn't there a hotel that    takes tried-to-kill-your-sister-types?" Giles doesn't look too pleased    either. Faith tries to joke it off, but she's obviously bothered. Buffy says    that she has to go to the hospital and check out the situation with the wounded    girl, but Dawn (still glaring at Faith) says that Willow has been calling and    that she's staying there. Buffy heads off as Giles says that they'd better find    somewhere for Faith to sleep. Both he and Dawn walk off, still glaring.

Entering the front door of the Summer's home later that    day, Buffy shows Wood in, explaining to him how the Potential Slayers all started    arriving, mentioning the Council of Watchers has since been destroyed, and both    look around at the living room where it looks slightly un-living room like,    with sleeping bags rolled up in all corners and research books strewn about.    But then an oven-mitted, aproned Andrew comes marching in with a disgusted look    on his face as he folds his arms "Where the hell have you been? This funnel    cake has been kicking my ass!" Buffy smiles awkwardly as she introduces    Andrew and Wood, who shake hands. Buffy introduces Andrew as their "hostage",    but Andrew sees himself as a "guestage." Wood questions the hostage    part. Buffy starts to explain that Andrew was evil, but now he's not so evil,    and then abandons the explanation. Andrew complains to Buffy that their secret    headquarters isn't so secret anymore, and if Buffy keeps bringing people in    they're gonna see the "big board." Buffy says they don't have a big    board, which makes Andrew run off and grab a big 3'x4' whiteboard with "Sunnydale    "Big Board"" written as a title at the top. A rough map of Sunnydale    is displayed, with a castle as their headquarters and little"demon faces"    scattered about representing the First's appearances. Buffy and Wood look on    in sarcastic shock and then turn and walk silently past Andrew as he asks "Where    do we put our receipts?"

Buffy then confronts the zombie ghost, asking what it wants "Fear? Revenge? Tasty Brains?" The younger zombie teen walks in behind the first, then the girl teen zombie, claiming that Buffy was too busy with her dead boyfriend while she was being ripped apart by a werewolf. All three start to blame her, but she interrupts, saying she doesn't care how they died, only that she wants to know where her sister is. They say "This place is ours now, it was built on our graves. All we want is for you to leave, so we can rest again." Buffy notices they are trying to interpose themselves between Buffy and a door.

Although shaken by these revelations, Buffy remains dedicated to protecting Dawn's life and defeating Glory before she can use Dawn in her ritual. Gregor also informs Buffy that, upon Glory's banishment, she was bound to a newborn human male, who has served as her host body ever since and who is now an adult, whose identity the Knights, despite their best efforts, have yet to learn ; if that man is killed while in mortal form, then Glory, within him, will also perish and, without the threat of Glory's ritual, Dawn herself will pose no further danger to the dimensional boundaries. Buffy is adamant that it is Glory, not Dawn, who will die.

Cassie then says Willow can avoid it if she stops all magic use, which Willow willingly agrees to, but then questions because of what Giles said, wondering if she will be able to control herself and won't go off the wagon again? She says in a worried tone that she's not strong enough, she's not an Amazon. Cassie says there is one other choice, one thing Willow can do to save her friends.

Buffy runs into a cowboy vampire at the mall, then returns to her mom Joyce, who is becoming increasingly annoyed about her daughter's lack of responsibility. The next day at school in health class, the students are asked to take care of an egg as if it were a baby, to teach them how much responsibility it takes to be a parent. Giles warns Buffy about the vamp she ran into -- he and his brother, the Gorches, are cowboy vampires, but he's not sure why they've been drawn to Sunnydale at this time. But Buffy's head is not into slaying or egg-raising these days -- she's ever more into the dreamy Angel, and her nights at the cemetery have become nothing more than make-out sessions with her undead man. When Buffy returns from her non-productive investigation of the Gorches, she finds her egg baby shaking -- she's wigged. A gross scorpion-like slimy creature bursts from it and attacks her, but she manages to stab it to death. She calls Willow to let her know what's happened, but Willow says her own egg baby is fine, and there's nothing to worry about. But we see that Willow is lying, because her own egg is indeed broken apart, and she has a spaced-out look on her face. When Joyce enters Buffy's room and finds her fully dressed, she thinks she's getting ready to sneak out and grounds her.

Meanwhile, Anya and Giles cut the power to UC Sunnydale, including the Initiative compound, while Spike shows Buffy, Xander and Willow the secret entrance.

Back outside, Riley and Buffy go to the bombed out remains of Sunnydale High for shelter.  When Riley admits he was wrong about Oz, Buffy tells him there's more he needs to know.  She begins the complicated task of explaining her relationship with Angel.  Meanwhile, Oz tries to sort things out with Willow in his van.  The only thing that can make him upset enough to turn into a werewolf is her.  Since Willow is happy with Tara, he knows that the best thing for both of them is if he takes off again.

"I fell in love with a beautiful vampire girl down in Mexico and  now we're trying to make a go of it on the straight and narrow and put our lives  back together here in Sunnydale."

Buffy leaves to report to Giles in the library, and Willow tells Buffy that Giles was wanting to see her anyway. Inside, Giles is in the company of Wesley Wyndam-Pryce, Buffy and Faith's new Watcher and it's obvious that the man is stuffy, pompous and full of himself. Buffy reminds him that the last Watcher who turned up was evil, but Wesley assures her that, unlike Mrs. Post his credentials have been checked by Giles, although Buffy is still extremely unimpressed by him. She tells the two about the vampire that was bearing swords, and Wesley recognizes as being him from a cult that worshiped a demon named Balthazar, who led a cult of swordsman vampires before he was killed.

Her reaction to seeing Buffy's packed bag is much more heated.  Buffy tries to get out of the house, but Joyce stops her right in the middle of the main floor.  As everybody gathers around and watches, Joyce drops all her restraints and angrily chews out Buffy for what she did (and didn't do) over the summer.  Buffy tries to defend herself, but Xander joins in and offers his own cold remarks.  Just as it seems that everybody is against Buffy and her whole world is caving in, the zombies invade the household. They quickly and brutally attack and kill several of the guests, while everybody else runs for their lives.  Many try to keep the doors and windows blocked off, while others just panic in general.

Anya asks Xander what she is supposed to do; he cannot answer. Willow changes her shirt again and Xander expresses his desire to find Glory and exact justice, then complains about Joyce's negligent doctors. Anya asks if they will see the body, then if the body will be cut open, and Willow responds angrily. Anya tearfully says she does not understand how to behave, or why Joyce cannot go back into her own body, unable to understand human death, she states that it is all "stupid and mortal", and no one will tell her why things are happening. Xander puts his fist through the wall, making him bleed but feel oddly better. As the group leaves to visit Buffy at the hospital, Xander gets a parking ticket.

In the library, Buffy finds Ethan, the costume shop owner and Giles old friend who tried to kill her on Halloween. As she calls Giles, Ethan mentions the "Mark of Eyghon." Giles says she's in danger, and the dead Phillip enters. A panicked Giles shows up and, after a scuffle which leaves Jenny unconscious, Phillip turns into the green goo. Some of it gets on Jenny and when she comes to, she seems normal but we see her eyes flash. Research freak Willow discovers the "Mark of Eyghon" in a book: Eyghon possesses the body of a dead or unconscious host. They figure out that he's jumped from Phillip's body to Jenny's. Possessed Jenny, looking and sounding like a demon, tries to seduce Giles. When Buffy comes to the rescue, Jenny jumps out the window. Giles explains to Buffy that he ran with a bad crowd when he was young, and they used Eyghon as a temporary high -- directing him in and out of each others' bodies. But one friend died, then later the girl who killed Phillip, and now it seems the rest of the group will die, too. Buffy goes to the deserted costume shop to try to help Ethan but he knocks her out, ties her up and tattoos her. He pours acid on his own tattoo so that Eyghon will take Buffy instead of him. Jenny enters, a full-tilt demon, and Buffy breaks free. Angel enters suddenly and chokes Jenny: the spirit leaves her body and enters Angel's, since he's really dead (Willow's plan: you go, girl!) It passes through Angel, and Jenny's back to normal,but Ethan escapes.

"Hello? I'm Buffy, I'm the Slayer?" Buffy has    come upon three men, "Shadow men", who sit cross legged on the ground.    They are dressed in tribal clothing, each holding a staff, and despite them    speaking Swahili, Buffy seems to be able to understand them. In subtitles, the    men say they know who Buffy is and why she is there. All three rise and start    walking around Buffy in a circle, saying that she was expected and that the    end is approaching. They then say the startling revelation "You are the    hellmouth's last guardian." Buffy tries to correct them by saying "latest"    guardian, but they say no. Buffy then says she came there to learn, so tell    her what she needs to know. The men on the other hand have no knowledge to offer,    only power. Buffy then begins to rant, saying she's probably not even there    and it's a dream, but from behind one of the men strikes her hard on the head    with his staff and she falls unconscious..

Introduction to Buffy the Vampire Slayer
|
At the Magic Box, Giles recognizes that he must stand aside if Buffy is to face her responsibilities in caring for Dawn instead of relying on him  and Tara finds a picture of the forget-me-not flower Willow used to cast a spell on her in a book of magic. Giles and Tara separately resolve to leave the people they love, respectively Buffy and Willow - Giles wants to leave Buffy for her own good, while Tara wants to leave Willow because she has become horrified by Willow's magical manipulation of their relationship . Captured by Spike outside the store, one of Sweet's minions conveys a challenge from Sweet for Buffy to rescue Dawn from The Bronze. Giles forbids the gang to assist Buffy, so she goes alone, despite having no will to do so; eventually Giles and the Scoobies change their minds and leave to catch up. Although Spike initially thinks that things would be better for him if Buffy was dead, he also changes his mind and decides to help Buffy; Sweet opines that Buffy is drawn to danger .

Buffy and Angel talk over weapons, and Angel tells Buffy he will not be saying goodbye after the battle. A grief-stricken Buffy unwraps the knife she used to stab Faith, still stained with her blood. The graduation ceremony begins and Principal Snyder welcomes the students before the Mayor takes the podium. During his speech he starts to convulse, an eclipse turns the sky into night, and the Mayor transforms into Olvikan, a giant snake-like demon. At Buffy's command, the entire student body removes their robes to reveal weapons and crosses.

|
Buffy pokes the demon in the eyes with her thumbs, successfully killing it and ending the paralysis on both Willow and Dawn. Buffy and Xander look where they think Willow is, while Anya runs for help, and slowly the spell making them invisible to each other wears off. Willow is relieved to see her friends and glad they didn't abandon her.  In the morning, Willow meditates and uses magic from the earth to re-grow the skin she lost. Buffy stops by to talk with Willow for the first time since their fightin theMagic Box. Willow reveals that her fear of seeing her friends and their judgment of her led to the invisibility problem from which they all were suffering. Buffy confesses her guilt over briefly suspecting Willow of the grotesque killing when Xander didn't, but Willow doesn't blame her for that. Willow struggles to start meditating again, but she's still weak. Buffy offers her Slayer strength to her friend, and joins in the meditation.

|
In the alley behind the Bronze, Buffy hears suspicious clattering around a corner. She asks Ford to go back and get her purse and then runs around toward the sound. Ford heads toward the Bronze just for a second before turning back and following Buffy, where he watches her stake a vampire. She makes up a lame story about cats but Ford reveals that he knows that she is the Slayer, having found out shortly before she was expelled from Hemery High, although the episode provides no details on how he learned Buffy's secret.

The Scooby Gang discusses plans for Buffy's birthday and dealing with Glory. Gilestells everyone of the new information they have regarding Glory that the council has provided; she was a hellgod from one of the darker demon dimensions who has somehow found her way into ours. While she is immortal and apparently invulnerable due to being stuck in human form, she is also mostly insane and needs to suck mental energy from humans, thus explaining the sudden increase of people going crazy in Sunnydale. Xander suggests that they try hunting down the Key that Glory is looking for, but as the gang start to discuss this plan Buffy and Giles admit they know where the Key is. Xander and Willow are hurt that information was kept from them, and Buffy decides to tell the gang the truth about Dawn, reasoning that they deserve to know the full story as their lives will be on the line. Several of the Knights of Byzantium chant around a fire before they are interrupted by Jinx, one of Glory's minions. Glory arrives and kills all of the Knights except Orlando, whom she later tortures for information.

Doris also tells her supervisor that "There was a voice. It made my coffee dance", not knowing that invisible Buffy was teasing and moving the coffee cup to make Doris react and appear insane. The supervisor believes that Doris is having a mental break with reality and sends her home, saying that he would send someone else to inspect the Summers' home the next day.

It's a new year, and Buffy is matriculating at UC Sunnydale. Willow is completely in her element in a place of higher learning, and Oz, whose band has played on campus several times, is right at home as well. Giles is entertaining an old girlfriend who is visiting from England, and Xander is away on a cross-country trip.

Meanwhile Buffy feels like a fish out of water. Her classes are harder, she has almost no friends, she drops a pile of books on a cute guy, and her roommate is too annoyingly perky for words.

But when a fellow student goes missing and Buffy suspects supernatural badness, she begins to think that college life may not be so different after all.

As Billy's Little League coach shows up, it is obvious he is the inspiration for the ugly man, and that he beat Billy into a coma after they lost the game. He tries to run after Buffy confronts him, but is stopped by Giles and Xander and put into jail. Buffy and her father leave for their weekend together. Willow then asks Xander if he was still attracted to Buffy as a vampire. Although he initially and nervously denies it, Xander then admits: "I'm sick. I need help." Willow agrees.

Principal Wood sits in his office at night, listening to muzak and writing a report or something. In the background through a window, we see a slightly out of focus Buffy walk into view. She pauses a distance away and then raises the bazooka to her shoulder, taking aim directly at Wood. A muffled "Erraaaaaarrr" is heard as we see Spike dive and slam into Buffy, knocking her to the ground, out of shot. They struggle past the window briefly, then Spike runs by again with the bazooka, with Buffy in hot pursuit. They dissapear just as Wood turns momentarily, thinking he heard something.

Looking like a trauma center, Buffy tends to a wounded SIT    in the living room of the Summers home, asking Willow to take care of the badly    bleeding SIT by her. Willow rushes to her side as Buffy rushes to the front    door. Giles and Xander carry a still-unconscous Faith in the front door and    immediately up the stairs to a room that's been prepared. Buffy then rushes    to get some medical supplies as Kennedy asks if Faith will be ok, knowing that    Slayers heal fast. Buffy says she doesn't know. The other SIT's then notice    Buffy pick up the scythe and ask about it. Buffy says she took it from Caleb    and thinks it could be important. "Let's hope!" Vi says. "I think    we got punished..." Amanda says, very downtrodden. The others agree, admitting    to Buffy that they followed Faith and things didn't work out good. Buffy says    it's not Faith's fault, it was a trap, something she could have fallen for.    One of the SIT's asks if Buffy is "back." Buffy says she doesn't know,    she's around for now, as she heads towards the stairs with the medical supplies.    The SIT's ask if there's a plan. Buffy says "Yes, they're coming, so get    ready."

Suddenly, the windows and doors break all over the house as robed figures attack the Scooby Gang. In a deserted location, Principal Wood buries Jonathan's body. The gang fights a vicious battle with the robed figures attacking them. Dawn handles herself pretty well with a couple of them while Buffy chases one upstairs and protects Andrew from being killed. Most of the robed figures are disabled or killed, but they didn't come for Buffy and the gang; they came for Spike. Down in the basement, Buffy and Xander find that Spike's chains are empty and he's nowhere to be seen. Buffy recognizes the faces of the robed figures as harbingers representing The First  and realizes that's who they're dealing with. The ghosts haunting them, the games being played on them and the impending danger that will come from beneath are all connected to the First Evil.

Jonathan explains that the demon cannot be killed by decapitation; he must be annihilated completely.
|
In the library, the gang discuss the recent murder. As it happened during the day, Oz is exonerated (as is Angel to Buffy's relief, although she has still not told anyone of his return) to everyone's relief. The Scoobies must look for a murderer who kills during the day.
|
The cobra-like demon arrives at the Magic Box and goes after Dawn. Dawn screams in fear and the demon, having found its target, leaves to report to Glory. Giles and Buffy, knowing what will happen if the snake reaches its destination, go after it and corner it near the luxury apartments where Glory resides. With the help of a chain, Buffy is able to beat it to death and continues thrashing it long after as a way of finally letting out her anger over her mother's condition. Nearby Glory watches from a window, frustrated as the snake fails to return.
|
On their coffee date, Willow fills Tara in on all of the supernatural activities that Tara has missed over the past months. Anya interrupts them and tries to maneuver them into wishing harm to Xander. She does the same with Dawn at the Magic Box and with Buffy at home; but no one takes the bait. Xander shows up at Buffy's house and Anya leaves in a huff. Buffy talks him out of following Anya and he takes his aggressions out by kicking a lawn gnome on Buffy's front lawn. When Buffy doesn't recognize the decoration as something she put there, Xander examines it and finds that it contains a small camera. They guess that it was placed by Spike, who has more than once been caught watching the house in the past.
|
Xander returns to the school with Angel, who pretends to be his former evil self. Though Spike first welcomes Angel as a long-lost friend, he sees through the ruse and Xander and Angel are forced to flee. Xander hears Spike call Angel his "sire" and "Yoda." Buffy and Spike finally meet in the hall, and Buffy is almost bested when her mother shows up and hits Spike over the head with the flat of a fire axe. With the curse "Women!", he retreats. Joyce tells Buffy that she doesn't care about what Snyder said and is proud to have a daughter who knows how to take care of herself and others in a crisis. Snyder tells the police chief to say that the trouble was caused by a gang on PCP. When the chief wonders if people will believe it, Snyder asks if he'd rather tell the truth. Meanwhile, not knowing the vampires are long gone, Willow and Cordelia are still hiding out in the utility closet where Cordelia prays to God to be rescued, while Willow is desperate to be rescued from her company.

The Bronze is packed and Oz and the Dingoes are playing on stage. After a song wraps, Oz goes to stand by his friends and Willow and Xander act jumpy-they feel guilty because of the kiss they'd shared. They wonder briefly if Buffy has a new boyfriend, and Buffy jokes that she is seeing someone-Faith-as they have a "patrol date" that night. The two go out to slay together, killing two vampires. Then, a new woman, who later identifies herself as Mrs. Gwendolyn Post-Faith's new Watcher-doesn't appreciate the "sloppy" synchronized slaying.

Tara performs a spell intended to release them from the house, but instead it releases the demon from the sword Buffy brought home. It attacks the group and Richard takes a cut to the chest before the demon retreats into the walls. While the wound is tended, noises can be heard in the walls and Anya begins to show signs of claustrophobia. Xander comforts her, then is also attacked. Buffy and Spike fight the demon back into hiding; although he is injured, Xander shows more concern for Anya's state of shock than his own physical well-being. Buffy and Dawn finally talk. Xander and Anya both press her to act but Tara is opposed, and Willow is scared that if she starts using magic again, she may not be able to stop. Dawn tells Buffy that she recently talked to a guidance counsellor. Meanwhile, Anya searches Dawn's room, convinced that she has something to do with their entrapment. Dawn enters with her sister and is freaked out by the invasion of privacy, but Anya uncovers Dawn's secret stash of stolen jewellery and objects from the Magic Shop.
|
Suddenly, a shadowy figure passes the window, and the girls hear a knock on the door. Buffy hopefully whispers "Mom..." and heads towards the door. Just then, Dawn realizes that some things just aren't meant to be, and a split second before Buffy whips the door open, Dawn rips apart the picture of her mom. At that moment, opening the door to nothing,Buffy breaks down, finally facing the reality of her mother's death. Buffyfalls into Dawn's arms, holdingher for the first time sinceJoyce's diedand bothsisters break down uncontrollably, united in their grief.

That night, Buffy goes to Spike's crypt but leaves before he comes to the door.  On patrol, she follows a woman's screams and is attacked by demons.  The timeline of the fight seemingly flows out of order.  Spike attacks the demons, while a disoriented Buffy accidentally strikes the female victim, apparently causing her to fall to her death; the woman was actually Jonathan magically disguised as Katrina, whom Buffy did not recognize, and the Trio then planted Katrina's real corpse at the scene.  Spike pulls a distraught Buffy away from the scene.  She goes to sleep and has a disturbing dream about Spike and Katrina.  Waking, she tells Dawn that she has to go the police over her involvement in a woman's death; assuming Buffy will be taken away from her as a result, Dawn accuses Buffy of being emotionally absent and actively looking for a way to be separated from her.

Willow goes to get coffee and runs into Angel. He tells her he's not evil, and that he's just looking out for Buffy because she might be in trouble.

As the fight progresses, Spike continues to relive the events that transpired between himself and his mother on a more conscious level, due to the Prokaryote Stone. Wood takes advantage of Spike's flashbacks, and using weapons, knocks Spike around until he cannot stand, when he then attempts to stake him. Spike regains control of his own mind, having faced his own anger and regret on turning his mother into a vampire and then being forced to kill her. Spike then easily defeats Wood, and demonstrates that the song has no more power over him, and tells Wood that the difference between his mother and Wood's mother, is that Spike's mother actually loved him back (referring to a previous comment he made that Wood's mother did not love him enough to give up her Slayer duties.) Spike then tells Wood that he's going to kill him and moves to bite him.

Later, Xander explains to Giles and Cordy that the creature got away before he could get a good look at it. Without Cameron gone, Giles determines the pattern of the killing is connected to the swim team ranks. Dodd and Cameron were the first and second best swimmers on the team, respectively. Since Gage is the third best, he would most likely be the creature's next target. Buffy decides to keep an eye on Gage, while Willow interrogates Jonathan, who has tried out for the team several times but never made it on. All Willow learns is that Jonathan peed in the pool. Later that night, Gage confronts Buffy about her spying on him. She tries to come up with a good excuse, then simply tells Gage what's really going on. He doesn't buy it, so he turns and walks out. Outside, he meets Angel, who promptly sinks his teeth into Gage's neck, hoping to turn him into a demon. Buffy arrives on the scene just in time to witness Angel suddenly withdrawing his fangs from Gage's neck and spitting the blood out. He tosses Gage's weakened body at Buffy and makes his escape, all the while spitting out the blood in disgust. Gage believes Buffy now, so he asks her to walk him home.

Meanwhile, Mayor Wilkins summons a shrouded man to his office for a special job, one that involves the removal of one's soul.  Back at Sunnydale High, Buffy tells Willow what she saw at the mansion between Angel and Faith. Willow assures Buffy that she has nothing to worry about, for Angel would never fall for Faith's moves.  Little do they know that Faith is at the mansion at this very moment, putting the moves on Angel once again.  When he places his hands on Faith's shoulders to let her know that everything will be okay, she douses a dark liquid onto the center of Angel's chest.  The shrouded man suddenly appears out of nowhere and casts a spell that surrounds Angel in a field of energy.  Once Angel falls to the floor, the shrouded man disappears.  When Angel gets back up, he's in full vamp-face, hungry for Faith's kiss.  After they part lips, Angel knocks Faith to the floor.  He thanks her for turning him back into the evil Angelus.  Faith whips out her stake and forces Angel to listen to her.  When he finally agrees, Faith leads him to the Mayor's office... but not until after they kiss again on the floor.

"So, you meet someone and you form a bond..." Holden says. "... and it never lasts." finishes Buffy. She lays on a tomb as if it were a shrink's couch, with Holden sitting nearby 'analyzing' her. She comments how her parents split and that she is showing similar resoning by never finding the right guy. Holden comments that she's scared to commit, but she takes offense, saying she's committed, she's a committe! Holden then says sarcastically it's all the guys faults, which makes Buffy rise and says it's different. Holden then says that Buffy's too young to be settling down anyways, she's only 21. He says that just because he really loved his college girlfriend he's not gonna go and "vampify" her so they can live forever. "Sire" Buffy corrects him, saying that when a person is made into a vampire, it's called siring. Holden gets up and is full of wonder, saying he has so much to learn, then says it is odd that he couldnt' even talk to her in high school and now they're moral enemies. "Hey, wouldn't it be cool if we became Nemisies?" he says. "Is THAT how you say the word?" Buffy asks. Holden then gets a bummed look on his face, realizing they're gonna have to fight to the death. Buffy says it's part of the plan, which Holden says is cool, he's got his blood lust pumping. He then thanks her for the chat and getting caught up. He then says he should stop by some of his old high school friends and catch up with them, which makes Buffy grow meloncoly. Holden sees this and backpeddals, wondering what's up, if she's sad because they're gonna fight. Buffy says it's because she's gonna win. Holden calls her on her cockyness, saying she's a little bit too self assured, especially with him knowng Ti-quan-do and such, and claims she has a superiority complex. She argues back but then out of nowhere Holden asks her who's fault she thinks her parent's divorce was? Buffy starts to walk away, thinking the topic "insane troll logic" but Holden presses and Buffy then grows meloncoly again. She admits she feels it's her Father's fault. Then Holden puts two and two together for her, asking her if she thinks that because of her Dad's failure, the reason she now has trouble connecting with Guys is because she thinks she's better than them.

At the magic shop, Dawn feels awkward because of the way everyone is treating her and notices when Giles hides a book in a hidden counter drawer. Buffy opens presents from her friends and everyone gets quiet when she receives a framed picture of herself and Dawn  from her sister. Dawn finally gets upset and confronts everyone about their strange behavior around her, then storms to her room. After sneaking out of the house, Dawn runs into Spike, who was keeping his nightly watch outside Buffy's house. After a brief conversation, Dawn tells Spike that she is on her way to the Magic Shop to steal a book. Spike notes the myriad dangers of roaming around alone at night, and then he accepts Dawn's offer to let him tag along. With Spike's assistance, Dawn breaks into the shop and finds the Book that she had seen Giles hide earlier. By candlelight, Dawn and Spike read about the truth of Dawn and the Key. Oddly, Spike treats this revelation with total equanimity; Dawn's reaction, of course, is far more vivid.

Pete yells at Debbie, then turns into a monster with very noticeable veins running across his face. He tells her that he needed the substance before to turn into the monster, but now her grating voice is already enough for him to transform. At first one could see his behaviour as a form of steroid rage, but it quickly becomes clear that this is a case of domestic violence, since he begins beating Debbie, then apologizes, turning back into his human self. She forgives him.
|
Later, Andrew talks to the video camera and uses his big white board to illustrate and explain the array of evil forces in Sunnydale. He continues to interview the residents of the house, starting with the Potential Slayers. He introduces a romanticized version of everyone to the camera (in his fantasy, Buffy seductively pours cereal, Spike appears without a shirt, and Anya eats from a bunch of grapes). Buffy reiterates her irritation with Andrew's behavior. As she describes her vision of vampire armies to her friends, Andrew sneaks away to continues his narrative, describing an idyllic scene of himself as leader of the Trio. As Buffy continues to talk, Andrew observes Willow and Kennedy and recounts his encounter with Dark Willow. Altering the past, Andrew imagines himself standing up to Evil Willow and deflecting her power while Jonathan meekly hides behind him.

Later that night, Buffy and Faith sneak into Finch's office at City Hall to see if they can find any info that might explain why he was in the alley that night.

Dawn tracks Buffy to the tower and follows the Slayer as she heads to the top.  Buffy remembers what occurred the last time she was there until Dawn interrupts. Buffy questions if she's in hell and contemplates another jump. The tower starts to collapse as Dawn begs Buffy to come with her - she and the others need her. When she sees Dawn in danger, Buffy's natural instincts come to the fore and she uses a rope and pulley to get them partially to the ground.

Kennedy and Dawn slowly get up as Willow is now in full    Wiccan way, chanting up a storm in Latin, meaning business. Then the words change...    "Screw it! Mighty forces, I suck at Latin, OK? But that's not the issue.    I'm the one in charge and i want that portal open NOW!" Xander, Dawn, Kennedy,    and Anya look on as Willow's power grows, then suddenly Willows hands go back    and a blue aura lights them up as they search for the nearest two beings...    Anya and Kennedy! Both the women glow blue for a few seconds and then collapse    on the floor, stunned, as a portal suddenly opens up in front of Willow. Xander    pulls Dawn back further as Kennedy tries to recover, wondering what just happened.

Buffy returns home and attempts to hold herself together, but after seeing the cross that Angel gave her and his ring still on her finger, finally suffers an emotional meltdown and collapses onto her bed, sobbing uncontrollably. Falling asleep, Buffy has another dream where she's initially with Angel making love before standing in a graveyard with him and Jenny, and Buffy realizes that Jenny knows more than she's letting on. The next day, a furious Buffy confronts Jenny by slamming her on a desk, and although Giles tries to stop her, Jenny shocks him when she admits that she is a member of the clan that originally cursed Angelus. Reluctantly, she confesses that it was a moment of total happiness that caused him to lose his soul. Buffy tells her to curse Angel again, but Jenny explains that the magic is long since lost to her people. When Buffy, Jenny, and Giles visit Enyos for answers, they find that Angelus has brutally murdered him, leaving the message "Was it good for you too?" daubed in blood. Giles tells Buffy that Angelus is trying to make it harder for her, but Buffy feels that he's just making it easier, knowing she'll have to kill him.
|
"It sounds like it's difficult for you" says Buffy to an unseen student. "Like maybe your sister makes it hard for you to establish your own identity. You said she's controlling, she doesn't let you make your own decisions..." We then see it's Dawn who Buffy is talking to in her office. "Yeah, and she borrows my clothes without asking..." Dawn says.

Years later, in their kitchen, Anya yells at Xander for ruining her life and blames him for her misery. He yells back, raising a frying pan - but the vision of the future abruptly ends as he hurls the pan at her. Xander, shocked by the visions, is warned by the old man not to marry Anya.
|
Buffy tosses in her sleep, then wakes up thirsty, but the water glass by her bed is empty. Seeming unaware that Drusilla silently follows, she carries her glass down the hall to find that her bathroom is really The Bronze. Buffy moves through the crowd of people dancing in slow motion, sees Willow speaking French to an organ-grinder's monkey, then encounters her mother who asks "Do you really think you're ready, Buffy?" before the saucer she holds drops to the floor and smashes. As Joyce turns away, Buffy moves back into the crush, then turns herself, smiling at something she sees behind her. The crowd has parted and Angel is slowly coming toward her, quietly smiling as well. Suddenly, Drusilla steps up behind Angel and stakes him in the back. Angel, his face a mask of agony, reaches toward Buffy's reaching hand, but his fingers turn to dust before they can touch. In vamp-face, Drusilla says "Happy birthday, Buffy." and Buffy wakes with a gasp.

"Spike's a liability Buffy. He refuses to see it, and    so do you..." Giles says in the night-time graveyard as Buffy continues    her fight with Richard the Vampire. Buffy tries to counter Giles' argument by    saying it's different now because Spike has a soul, but Giles says that the    First is exploiting that to it's advantage. It's then that Buffy realizes that    she's being stalled. She almost absentmindedly swings behind her and dusts Richard    and confronts Giles. "It's time to stop playing the role of General, and    start being one" Giles says as Buffy sprints off.
|
Xander, clad in spiffy business suit, steps out of a semi-luxiorious car and approaches the Summer's home, a roll of Blueprints in his hand. Buffy calls out to Dawn, telling her to hurry up, they'll be late. Walking into the kitchen, Xander asks Buffy how she's doing. Buffy expresses concern about sending Dawn to the same High School that tried to kill her for 3 years and that she's not ready to know what's gonna happen, but she's overall fine. Xander then motions her over to a table where he rolls out a set of Blueprints for the newly constructed Sunnydale High School, commenting that there are no pentagrams, secret passageways, and that everything is safe. He does note one interesting detail, though, matching the old school blueprints with the new, and he notes the location of the hellmouth, that was underneath the library, is now underneath the principal's office. "So the principals evil?" Dawn asks. "That or in a boatload of danger" remarks Buffy. It's the first day of school and Buffy asks if she's got everything "Books, lunch, stakes?" Just before they get ready to leave, Buffy smiles and brings out a wrapped box... a first schooldays present for Dawn. Dawn smiles and asks if it's a weapon? "Yes... it is..." Buffy says, smiling oddly. Just as the box is opened...
|
Mayor Wilkins comforts Faith at her new apartment by reminding her that once the Ascension takes place, her broken friendship with Buffy and the others will be irrelevant.  At the library, Giles thanks the shrouded man for participating in the scheme to expose Faith and the Mayor's plans. The shrouded man announces that his debt to Giles has been paid.  After the shrouded man disappears into thin air, Giles informs everyone that he introduced the shrouded man to his wife -- thus, the debt.  While Wesley and the others discuss the newly-learned information concerning the Ascension and its date, Buffy reminds Xander that Angel was only acting when he punched him.  However, Buffy doesn't seem so sure of her own words. Later, Buffy visits Angel at the mansion.  He assures Buffy that he never meant to take the act so far as to hurt her.  Disturbed by the harsh reminder of what Angel could become again, Buffy insists that they put their relationship on hold for a while.
|
Meanwhile, Dawn has just run out of the car to get away from the vampire. He stops her, telling her in an unconvincing monotone that she's different from other girls; he could tell when he first met her that she was special. As he leans in to bite her, he says that it's OK and that it will only hurt for a second. At that moment, Giles finds Dawn and tells her that Justin says that to all the girls. As Giles approaches to fight him, a crew of vampires, surround them.

The big battle starts, with Willow taking on one figure (and  getting knocked out) and Dawn the other. It is here where we see Dawn is quite  the little fighter! Buffy joins another one in battle, coming from downstairs.  She easily handles one with some sort of staff weapon, but then another attacks  her from behind. The figure then charges upstairs and Buffy pursues.
|
The Scooby Gang rush to find Buffy and figure she is at her house. The bikers are on the run now that Razor has been killed. At the house, Buffy is confused and acting weird as she surveys the changed scenery of her house and is told by Dawn that Giles has left. Spike arrives, angry and looking for Dawn. When Dawn and Buffy walk downstairs, Spike speaks to Dawn; although he initially thinks Buffy is the repaired Buffybot, he changes his mind when he gets a clear look at Buffy, while also realizing without being told that Buffy is back. He softens and helps clean up her wounded hands. They talk about how long she's been gone; Spike has counted the days, all 147 of them. When the Scooby Gang arrives and focuses on the Slayer, Spike slips out.
|
"It was extrodinary good luck..." Giles tells    the tale of his near-death escape as he and a small group of scoobies walk in    a graveyard at night (during which we get a shot of a very large gravestone    marked "Snyder"). Giles asks the newest Slayer in Training Chow Ann    to keep up with them as Buffy, Kennedy, and Amanda listen intently to Giles'    "dramatic" tale. Suddenly Giles is bulldozed to the ground by someone!

Cut to Faith and Wood in the school, pushing boxes and filing    cabinets, setting up a barricade. Wood comments that Buffy's plan is out there,    but good. He then says that they just have to work on blocking access to the    sewers should the Ubervamps get out. Faith says that's if they get past them,    then quips "come on, gotta have a little faith." "i think I've    had my share, thanks." Faith apologizes in her own way for "blowing    Wood off" after their little roll in the hay, but she was just trying to    blow him off. Robin says he pretty much figured that one out all by himself.    Faith explains that's just the way she is, not wanting to get talky with a guy    after getting bouncy with him. Robin calls that weak, but at least it's not    "some of that isolationist Slayer crap" he's gotten used to before.    Robin then tries to defend men to her, saying that there are nice guys out there.    Faith says that when guys see her, their priorities shift, because she's so    hot. Robin sasses back, saying he's so much prettier than she is, and that their    little night together wasn't bad, but it wasn't all that great. Faith is surprised    and offensive, saying she was great, but Robin says that while she was very    enthused, it didn't change his world. Sh's had enough and wants a re-match,    starting to undo her belt and pants before Robin stops her, saying he wants    to make her a deal: if they live through this, he'll want a chance to surprise    her. Faith buckles up and agrees to the deal, then adds "there's no way    you're prettier than me." "Little bit, yeah..." Robin counters.

At Buffy's house, Willow uses her computer to try to trace the camera's signal. Given that it was not Spike, they correctly assume that the Trio are behind it.

Buffy returns to the library to retrieve Kendra's sword, where she runs into Snyder, who expels her, even though he knows that she is not the murderer. She insists that the truth will be revealed, and he points out that the law enforcement authorities in Sunnydale are "deeply stupid". Then Buffy pulls Kendra's sword out of her bag and taunts him, saying "You never ever got a single date when you were in high school, did you?" After she leaves, Snyder calls the Mayor with "the good news" of her expulsion.
|
Buffy finally gets a date when sensitive hunk Owen shows an interest in her. To Giles' exasperation, all Buffy can think about is impressing him with an uncharacteristic interest in the American poet Emily Dickinson.

Giles comes up, and tells Buffy that Faith's Watcher is dead. Buffy goes to see Faith, and begins talking about Kakistos, surprising Faith with the fact that the vampire is in town.

Episode Synopsis by: Zack Peacock
|
The Mayor is extremely angry that they got away with his box, but he suddenly becomes very happy when he finds that Faith has captured Willow. The gang don't find out about Willow's capture until they get back to the library (as each group thought she was with the other) and they're all very upset, especially Oz who sits in silence. Buffy decides that they will trade the box for Willow. Wesley is strongly against it and tells Buffy that she was right to take the offensive against the Mayor, and that by giving up the box they are sentencing all of Sunnydale to death.

At the Hall of Records, the gang locates an old photograph of Mayor Wilkins that was taken a century ago.  As Wesley realizes that Mayor Wilkins must be over a hundred years old, Xander arrives to tell them about the return of Angel's bad self.  Wesley suggests that they inform Giles, but Xander's news of Faith's involvement leads them to look for Buffy immediately. Buffy follows Angel and Faith to the mansion.  Once there, Angel reveals his recent change in personality to Buffy.  Attempting to escape, Buffy finds her exit blocked by Faith.  Angel knocks Buffy out cold, then ties her up in chains.  When Buffy comes to, Faith explains her reasons for taking the path she's taken.  Faith couldn't tolerate being in Buffy's shadow ever since she arrived in Sunnydale.  The popular belief that Buffy is superior to Faith has driven the new Slayer to where she is today. Buffy taunts Faith by claiming that she can stop the Mayor's Ascension. Faith laughs this off, telling them that the Ascension cannot be stopped and will take place, as planned, on Graduation Day.  With this information out in the open, Angel drops the evil Angelus act, while Buffy drops the chains that were supposedly restraining her.  When Faith realizes that it was all a set-up, she shoves Angel to the side and attacks Buffy. Wesley, Xander, and the rest of the gang arrive just in time to see Angel falling towards them.  As Angel and Xander go down, Buffy and Faith battle to a stand-still, with a knife held up to each other's throat.  Faith calls Buffy's bluff, then runs out of the mansion.

Back in the lecture hall, Harmony chats mindlessly to the doctor while he tries to remove the chip from Spike's brain. Buffy and Riley reach the hospital only to find that Spike and Harmony have kidnapped the doctor. Buffy swears that when she finds Spike, she'll rip his head off. Meanwhile, the doctor successfully removes the chip, delighting Harmony. Spike expresses his happiness as well, stating that now he can do what he's wanted to do for a long time - kill the Slayer. Just as the doctor finishes stitching him up, Buffy and Riley show up. As Spike informs Buffy about the removal of the chip, Harmony accidentally fires the crossbow, burying the arrow in Riley's leg. This sparks an all-out brawl in the lecture hall. Spike quickly gains an upper hand on Buffy, but as he goes to bite her, he grabs his head and recoils in pain. Riley quickly moves to subdue Harmony, but stops mid-punch and clutches his heart. As Riley falls to the floor, Spike discovers that the doctor duped him and did not actually remove the chip. Knowing they have no chance, he and Harmony run off. Later that night at the hospital, the doctor checks on Riley's heart and stitches up his leg, telling him that he should be fine. Buffy makes sure that Riley is better before leaving to go check on Joyce. After his recovery, Riley walks down the hall with Graham. Graham tells Riley that there's nothing for him in Sunnydale. He adds that Riley once had a mission and now it seems that his mission is only to be Buffy's boyfriend. As Riley storms off, Graham reminds him that he still belongs to the Initiative.

Glowing beneath her is an Orb of Thesulah. While she chants the curse, Angelus flees through the woods, trying to escape the scene of the crime, for he is the one responsible for the girl's death. The elder woman completes the curse, and Angelus is stopped in his tracks. He falls to his knees, and his eyes glow as his soul returns to his body for the first time in over a century. A gypsy man steps out of the woods and explains to Angel that he is being punished for the countless murders he has committed.

Later that night, Giles asks Willow for specifics regarding the spell she cast to bring Buffy back to life. Willow, eager to impress Giles, begins to boast about how scary the spell was, but Giles quickly takes the wind out of her sails by reminding her why such spells aren't practiced, including the possible consequences, noting that he left her in charge of the group because he thought she was the most responsible, which he now sees is clearly not the case. Although he tries to keep calm throughout the discussion, Giles ultimately loses control when Willow continues to boast of her performance and demands praise, and thunders that she is lucky to be alive after casting such a spell, calling her a "rank, arrogant amateur." Willow's tone of voice suddenly turns dangerous, as she warns Giles that she's powerful and pissing her off might not be such a good idea, before regaining her normal composure and telling him to just focus on the fact Buffy is back. Giles, however, reminds her that the gang still have no idea where Buffy has been or what she has been through.

Needing help, they go to the one man that can aid them.  After walking into a lush mansion, they approach a massive desk and ask the person concealed behind the chair for help.  The chair swivels around to reveal Jonathan Levinson, the Sunnydale High geek, looking suave and dangerous.  At Giles' house, Buffy, Willow, Xander, Anya, Jonathan and Giles discuss their plan of attack on the vampire nest.  Jonathan has all the answers and the group decides they should pretty much stick behind him.  When they enter the tomb to do battle, vampires rush at the gang from all sides.  Buffy manages to kill two of them but Jonathan emerges as the real hero, dusting vampires right and left with a crossbow while kicking and flipping his way across the room.  When the group emerges from the tomb, there's plenty of paparazzi waiting to score a candid photo of the leather-clad Jonathan.  When Spike appears on the scene, Jonathan is quick to confront him.  With no need to attack the harmless ex-vamp, Jonathan settles for giving him a good tongue-lashing and swaggers off.

She denies his request and Spike responds with a theory of his own, that Buffy likes men who hurt her and that's why she's never been able to kill him.

She smiles "Anya." Suddenly Halfrek raises her head, her eyes grow bright, and she is engulfed in flame, screaming, dissapearing in smoke. D'hoffryn turns to Anya and starts to scold her, asking her what she thought would happen?!?

With stake in hand, she lunges toward him. He vanishes and materializes behind her. Again she goes in for the attack and he disappears. Just then, Willow and Xander, who also happen to be patrolling, wander into the scene. As Buffy tells them to get out of there, Dracula materializes right behind them.

Buffy sends Faith away and spends the night searching for answers about the return of Angel. The next morning, Giles finds her asleep around books about demon dimensions and Acathla. She tells him she had a really vivid dream that Angel came back. Giles doubts it could happen, there being no record of such an event. He goes on to explain that with time passing differently in Hell (as Buffy found out in Anne) anybody who returned would have endured seemingly endless torture. Only with extraordinary character would one be able to have retained any semblance of ones self. Most likely they would've become a monster.

Kennedy lays on Willow's bed trying to relax as Willow sits    up, a nervous wreck, pouring over spell-like papers and notes. Kennedy says    what Buffy said is true, she's stronger than she thinks. Willow doesn't agree,    but Kennedy says that she'll be with her to keep her grounded. Willow then says    she might have to keep her stabbed-ed, to keep her from going to the "bad    place." Kennedy rises in disbelief, wondering if Willow is serious. "The    darkest place I've ever been... this is what lies beyond that..." Willow    says, which makes Kennedy question why Buffy believes in her so strongly. Willow    chalks it up to Buffy being brave and strong, but not that bright. Kennedy says    that she's the first one to call out Buffy's faults, but in this case she's    right, Willow has the power and she'll do fine, no matter how dark it gets.

Buffy says she's    going anyways. Giles argues further for the safety of the girls who have not    seen combat. Buffy says it's time for them to see some, at least the experienced    girls who have been with them longer. Spike says that it might be the old bait    and switch, with the First wanting all the power out of the way so he can come    back to the house and have the SIT's killed.

Dawn starts going over some of her classmates, saying that a "margo"    in her biology class wouldn't make a good SIT because she feignted during a    fetal pig dissection.

The First says that Caleb    is getting weak, which only gets Caleb more upset. The First says it's expected    because it's been some time since they've "merged."

The moon eclipses the sun, bringing darkness over the ceremony.  And before a stunned crowd, the Mayor morphs into a giant, twenty-foot dinosaur with a vicious set of teeth and a ravenous appetite.  But amid the ensuing chaos, the student body is ready.  Led by Buffy and a courageous Xander, the students rip off their gowns to reveal an arsenal of weapons.

In the melee, the demon dips down and grabs Principal Snyder between his jaws, and devours him.  Buffy sees her chance, and orders the class to retreat.  Now one on one with the Mayor, she taunts him with the knife that pierced Faith, and leads him on a chase through the high school.  The chase ends in the library, which is rigged with explosives.  All the Mayor can say is "Oh, gosh!" as he and the halls of Sunnydale High are blown back into hell.

Back in the Summers living room, everyone is gathered. Various    SIT's, most of which we haven't seen in past shows, all talk in mumbled voices,    softly sobbing, comforting each other. Xander, Dawn, Anya, and Spike are present    too. Buffy walks in, carrying the shovel, and asks if everyones there. Kennedy    says everyone's present. Buffy then asks if anyone wants to say anything about    Chloe. The room is silent. Buffy then says she will and opens up with "Chloe    was an idiot. Chloe was stupid. She was weak. And anyone in a rush to be the    next dead body I bury, it's easy. Just think of Chloe. I'm the Slayer, the one    with the power, and the First has me using that power to dig our graves."    Buffy throws down the shovel, quite pissed, as she starts to lay into the gathered    group, saying they're not doing anything to help and that they are all just    listening, not doing anything, not helping. All are looking quite ashamed, except    for Kennedy, who stands defiantly and says that Buffy is out of line. Willow    then defends Buffy briefly, saying she's not out of line. Kennedy fights, saying    that Willow is the most powerful one of the group, even more powerful than Buffy.    Buffy coldly tells Kennedy she's wrong, that she is the most powerful because    she's using her power.

After Willow tries to tell him that Oz will return, Professor Walsh informs her that he won't be back to her class, whereupon Willow abruptly leaves, saddened.

Entering Nancy's home, Xander and her do the light awkward banter thing. She thanks him, then says it doesn't sound right with everything he has done for her. She then asks if she can give him a call sometime. "To check in?" he questions. "No, actually I'm hitting on you." she answers. As he says yes and she turns, saying goodnight, the ground starts to shake. "Ah, Nancy, i just got a swell idea... RUN!" they both race down the hallway, with the floor bursting up behind them in a line. They reach some stairs and a landing where they are seemingly safe. At the foot of the stares, a giant worm like thing roars at them, opening its mouth (if you've seen Tremors, it's like one of those worms without the inner tentacles.). The worm dissapears and Nancy catches her breath, saying that Ronny would love this. Xander questions who Ronny is. She says Ronny is her ex, and he was trouble. Xander asks if he was the type of guy who would raise a demon, motioning to the floor. Nancy says that he was just an abusive bastard and wouldn't leave, always hovering.

Emerging from the underground lab and onto the surface for the first time, Adam slowly takes in his surroundings.  Adam soon comes upon a lone young boy in the woods.  When the boy's curiosity falls on the bone skewer in Adam's left arm, a knowing grin forms on the face of Maggie's creation.  The next morning, Buffy and the gang greet the new day with a news report on the television regarding the brutal murder and mutilation of a young boy in the woods.

Nighttime, deserted road, Xander drives with Dawn slowly    coming to. She asks what happened (actually she meant to say what the HELL happened)    when Xander says it was chloriform (sp?). He asks if she's still loopy? "Sorry    bout that, someone knocked me out with CHLORIFORM!"

In the basement Anya is giving the SIT's a lecture on Ubervamps. She's been gathering information from her old contacts. Andrew draws pictures on the whiteboard to go along with Anya's lecture. She says that they can kill an ubervamp with a stake through the heart, Andrew misspells stake as steak on the whiteboard, tries to fix it. Anya says staking them is a little bit like driving a piece of wood through solid steel, but they're all super strong so it should be all right. She's greeted with silence. She rambles on, the SIT's ask her what the point is, they're all feeling fairly hopeless. Anya says she doesn't want to be there either, she'd rather be at the bedside of her one eyed ex fiance. Not that that's very comfortable either, especially after the uncomfortable conversation they had over on Spike's cot after their extremely hot breakup sex. Andrew writes about the breakup sex on the whiteboard. The scene cuts with Anya still babbling on and on.

Helping Willow unpack in her old bedroom, Dawn gives the Wicca some pointers about how to handle her return to college classes: When to speak, when to shut up, and mainly "do what everyone else does." Willow smiles as she loads up her drawers with clothes, saying she's been to college before. Buffy and Xander walk in carrying a box and a lamp. "Have you talked with her lately?" Buffy asks. Xander says no, not since the Gnarl demon, and even then it wasn't such a happy talk. Xander thinks he should call Anya, but Buffy shows some uneasyness, not wanting Xander to get his hopes up. Xander says he's not, that he knows it's over with Anya, but he's a "strong, sucessful male who's giddy at the thought of all the women he will soon be dating in the near future." "Strong, successful men say 'giddy'?" Buffy cracks. Xander just says his concern is that she's lonely, she seems so sad. Buffy expresses concern at the "definite vengence vibe" Anya was eminating, but Xander says he actually understands that Anya just went back to what she knows, but that's not her now. He points out that she did turn the worm guy back and thinks that she's coming around.

He was battling a few Trolls and talks of how ugly they were. Aud sits Olaf down and starts to tend to him, putting away his great battleaxe, when Olaf looks around and notices an unusual amount of rabbits around the cottage. Aud tells him that they breed quickly (which briefly get's Olaf wanting to "breed" himself) and that she's been thinking of an idea to trade the rabbits to the townspeople for goods and services and will express goodwill. Olaf laughs, saying her logic is like that of a Troll, and that the matrons at the bar talk of her. Aud gets a very dark look on her face, asking if he was at the bar? Olaf unknowingly sidesteps the question, saying that it's not his fault they don't speak well of her because she speaks oddly and says what is on her mind.

At the Magic Box, Anya goes through the receipts and finds the items that Giles sold to Glory earlier and panics, saying that the items should not have been sold together due to them being the ingredients for a Sobekian transmogrification spell.

Unfortunately, the same spell creates trouble and the gang ends up fighting invisible demons until Tara releases them--allowing them to see her inner demon, which ends up being nonexistent. Yes, it's turns out to be just a family lie that dad told to keep the women subservient.

Faith reports her attack to the Mayor, and amuses him with a few stories from her childhood before he continues preparations for the ascension.

Giles and Anya both approach the oracle-demon (Picture a large veiny mass about the size of a beach ball, complete with veiny muscles coming from behind, and covered in small eyes.

When Dawn gets home from school, she talks with Tara, who tells her that it looks like a demon (referred to as "Sweet" in the credits) is responsible for the singing. Dawn mentions to Tara her recent argument with Willow, an argument Tara can't remember. She remembers the bramble she found in the bedroom that morning and has been wearing and begins to worry that Willow may have cast a spell on her and rushes out to check on whether this hunch is right. Dawn, now alone, goes through her stash of stolen goods, and puts on a necklace she took from the Magic Box. She starts singing about her life ("Dawn's Lament"), but is kidnapped by minions of Sweet, interrupting her song. When Dawn wakes up in The Bronze, she and three of Sweet's minions engage in an interpretive dance, which is Dawn's attempt to escape. ("Dawn's Ballet"). Sweet tap dances as he sings and explains that he thinks she is the one who summoned him, and he intends to take her to the Underworld and make her his queen ("What You Feel"). He also explains if the melodies go on too long, people will combust and burn up from the intensity of emotion. Dawn tells him that her sister is the Slayer, which pleases rather than frightens him-he tells his minions to bring her to him so he can see her burn.

Xander finally sends Buffy home. When her four drinking buddies turn into violent Neanderthals, he finds out that the owner of the pub has been brewing the beer as revenge for 20 years of college kids taunting him.

Willow asks "Tara" (through Cassie) if she knew about the events after Warren shot her, then comments that she hurt so many people. Tara (cassie) understands that she was grieving. Cassie says it was the power that did it, and while Willow argues that the power was within her and is a part of her, Cassie says the power is bigger than she is, and she must stop using it. Cassie then says Willow must not use magic at all from now on, no amount. Willow brings up Giles' view on how the magic's a part of her and not evil, but Cassie is firm and tells her she cannot use magic or she will hurt others. "They" have seen Willow's path and says "you're not going to be ok and you're going to kill everybody." A horrified look comes on Willow's face.

Buffy takes Dawn's hand & runs into the dorms. Willow thinks fast & does a spell to momentarily stop Glory. She juts Glory back & runs out with Tara. Buffy & Dawn run out of the dorms & out unto a road. Glory speed-runs (as in, the speed of light) to catch up with the girls. She asks Buffy if Buffy has any last words. Buffy replies: "just one: truck." A truck slams into Glory & she's thrown into another car. Then, she transforms into Ben. Buffy decides that Glory's too strong- she can't fight Glory, so they have to run away. The group- Buffy, Dawn, Xander, Spike, Willow, Tara, Giles, & Anya- head out in a van. Meanwhile, Ben talks to a minion (both not knowing that Glory knows who the Key is). What is gathered from this conversation is that if the Key's human form is killed, it will destroy the Key, & that if Ben or anyone kills it, he can have the body to himself. But, if the Key is used, Ben will disappear & Glory will take over the body completely. Ben says that Glory's taken away from him the only thing he ever loved- being a doctor. He says he wanted to be a doctor to be a part of humanity. The minion says that Ben exists only because of Glory. Ben says that this is his life now, however he came by it, it's his life to live. Also, a Knight who was brainsucked by Glory is taken out of the hospital by two other Knights. He, having seen Dawn & recognizing her as the Key because of his craziness, tells the other Knights that the Key's a girl. Knowing who is in Buffy's life, they gather that the monks made the Key human & put it in the form of the slayer's sister. They go to kill Dawn, catching up with the group on the run from Glory just as Buffy is complaining about how things just keep coming- first Glory, Riley, her mom, then Tara. The Knights invasion results in a car crash & a spear to Giles' chest. The group is forced to seek shelter in an abandoned gas station. Willow puts up a magical barrier to keep the Knights out, but not before Buffy captures their General.

The next day, Lily visits Buffy at work and tells her that Rickie's been missing for a while. Buffy reluctantly agrees to help, and they first visit the local blood bank where Lily and Rickie often donated in order to make some money. According to the doctor, Rickie hasn't been there in the last few days, so Buffy and Lily agree to split up and meet up later at Buffy's apartment. During a search in an abandoned building, Buffy finds a dead old man with a bottle of Drain Cleaner next to his head. Since the bottle is empty, the old man must have killed himself with it. However, that's not the most disturbing thing: Buffy notices a familiar tattoo on the man's forearm. It says "Lily", which means that this dead old man was Rickie. Back at her apartment, Lily cannot believe the news. She blames Buffy for bringing along some evil from Sunnydale, causing her boyfriend's untimely death. Lily exits the apartment and meets Ken, who tells her that Rickie is alive and staying at the Family Home. Relieved, Lily follows Ken to the shelter.

They both get jealous over each    other. Then Anya says she still loves him, and knows he still loves her. Xander    is left speechless when Andrew asks "Is that true Xander?

He confesses that he was wrong about Oz and that he was a bigot when thinking about Willow and Oz's relationship and couldn't see past the 'humans good, demons bad' idea, but Buffy reassures him he wasn't being a bigot but was just shocked when faced with an unconventional relationship . Buffy then volunteers to tell him about her past, and warns him that it's not stuff he's going to like. In Oz's van, Oz notes that he worked hard so he could return to Willow, and now she is the only thing that he can't be around without losing control of the wolf and now he needs to leave town again to escape her and the Initiative. Willow and Oz say their sad goodbyes accepting they will always be an important part of each other before Oz leaves Sunnydale forever. Later that night Willow takes a candle to Tara's room, where Tara tells Willow that she should be with the person she loves, and Willow replies that she is. Tara blows out the candle.

"Ok, now I'm pissed! Where is he?!?" Angel says,    getting up, still just a tad dazed, but pumped full of adreneline. Buffy looks    at Caleb's right side, then his left side "He had to split", and after    a second a laughing snort from Buffy at the goofyness of her pun. Spike, with    a look of distain on his face, still watches silently from the shadows, Buffy/the    First in the background observing also. Angel goes and picks up the folder he    brought as Buffy asks if it's from a reliable source? "Not remotely"    he answers. Angel then pulls out an amulet (both the amulet and paperwork are    given to him from Wolfram and Hart in Angel the Series), which makes Buffy comment    that she has nothing that will go with it. Angel says it's very powerful and    possibly very dangerous "Purifying power... clensing power... possibly    scrubbing bubbles..." Angel isn't sure what it is or how it works, but    he knows it's to be worn by a Champion, one with a soul, but more than human.    He says that he doesn't nearly enough to risk her wearing it though, and "besides,    you've got that real cool axe... thing." Buffy asks Angel if he's gonna    be in this with her? He says yes, shoulder to shoulder." From the shadows,    Spike hears this and, hurt, turns and leaves up some stairs.

Anya drives a car for the first time wildly through the streets while Willow, in the passenger seat, searches for a spell to stop the troll, who proceeds to wreak havoc in Sunnydale, bashing trash cans, smashing his hammer into things, and declaring to the people running in the opposite direction: "You do well to flee, townspeople. I will pillage your lands and dwellings. I will burn your crops, and make merry sport with your more attractive daughters, mark my words" before catching the scent of "ale" and heading toward the source.

Episode synopsis by Alan Hufana
|
Although Buffy now has Faith on her side they are still no match for The First who now has a young preacher named Caleb on his side.
|
Buffy and Willow are talking prom dresses while Giles is continuing research for the Ascension. Using the pages that Willow ripped out of the Books of Ascension, it's been determined that, upon Graduation Day, Richard Wilkins will transform into a demon. However, what kind of demon he will transform into is still unknown, and there's no further information at this point. As a result, the discussion moves onto the prom. Giles and Wesley will both be chaperoning, which Buffy says is going to be the one and possibly last night of fun they'll have in Sunnydale. Meanwhile, in a small house, someone plays a video for a caged dog-beast that causes it to freak out.

The leaves are changing color, the air is cooler, it must be time for... the Night of St. Vigius. Once again Buffy's life is in danger as the Master's minions seek to gain extra power by killing Buffy during a sacred holiday. But Buffy's mind is not on slaying. She and Sheila, a perpetually bad student, have been threatened with expulsion by Principal Snyder. The only chance they have of staying in school is to help organize Parent Teacher Night.
|
At the library, Willow and Ms. Calendar decide that the Hellmouth is underneath The Bronze, and leave. However, as they leave, they see an army of vampires approaching the library. Cordelia rescues them in her car, and drives the car straight into the school. Xander and Angel reach Buffy only to find that she is dead. Xander performs CPR (as Angel couldn't do it himself, since vampires don't breathe) and manages to revive her. When Buffy regains consciousness, she heads to the surface to kill the Master who is now above the library and using her power to summon all matter of beasts from the Hellmouth. Cordelia, Willow, Giles and Jenny fight off vampires trying to enter the library, and just as Giles realizes that the Hellmouth is directly underneath the library, a tentacled creature rises through the floor. Buffy throws the Master into the library, where he is impaled on a jutting piece of wood and his soft tissues disintegrate, leaving only his skeleton and the Hellmouth closes, sucking the tentacled creature back down.

Xander enters a class to find everyone staring at them -- he's only wearing boxer shorts. Buffy finds a newspaper picture of the boy who keeps appearing. The article says he's in a coma after falling down the steps after a little league game. Buffy notices his uniform number: 19. Giles says even though the boy's in the hospital, perhaps Buffy has been seeing his astral body, which can travel through time and space. Buffy's father picks her up at school and explains he left home because Buffy caused so much trouble and was a disappointment to him. He leaves Buffy in shock -- and the boy appears again. Willow and Xander talk to Giles, who explains that their nightmares have been coming true, leaving everyone vulnerable to all sorts of danger.

|
Suddenly D'Hoffryn appears, interrupting the battle. He first approvingly inspects Anya's scene of carnage in the other room, then reminds Buffy that attacking him is futile (she desists). D'Hoffryn compliments Xander's gallantry and Willow's solicitousness, and notes Buffy's bloody-minded resolution, but concludes by asking Anya what she wants to do. Anya asks to undo her act of vengeance, which is possible as her victims died "mystical deaths." D'Hoffryn warns that a sacrifice will be required... the life and soul of a Vengeance demon. Anya is willing to die to undo her recent actions, despite Xander's impassioned protests. D'Hoffryn makes Anya confirm she's willing to pay the price, then casts a spell... which summons Halfrek. Anya realizes what is about to happen, as D'Hoffryn kills Halfrek painfully by burning her from the inside out, completely immolating the vengeance demon. Anya is devastated at seeing her friend die and guilty that she is the one who caused it, as D'Hoffryn asks Anya who she thought she was dealing with, reminding her to "Never go for the kill when you can go for the pain!". He then turns Anya human again, and when Anya tells him she should have died, D'Hoffryn assures her there's plenty of time for that yet. Reminding everyone that "from beneath you, it devours" D'Hoffryn teleports away as the frat boys start to wake up.

The two lay on Spike's cot, Spike's arms holding Buffy while    they rest. Buffy stirs, then slowly gets up, deep in thought. She walks to the    open air of the room, looks out of the upper window at the moon as the moonlight    shines down upon her face. From the shadows, the form of Caleb appears "Pretty,    isn't it?" "You're not him" Buffy looks at him calmly, knowing    she's addressing the First. Caleb/the First says that Buffy killed his good    right arm, but he's not worried, he has an army. Buffy counters, saying mockingly    "an army of vampires... however will I fight..." Caleb verbally spars    back, saying that her army is a bunch of pimply-faced teens. Buffy spars back,    saying that he needs a new cool name like 'the taunter', not being able to do    much while incorporeal. Caleb/the First wonders why she's pretending to be so    calm when she's already up and not in the arms of her dead lover? He goes on    to say that he will be corporeal when his army's outnumber the humans on the    planet, and nobody's gonna be able to stop him, not Faith nor her friends nor    the Slayer brigade. The SIT's are powerless unless she's dead to pass the power    to one of them.

A wounded Buffy starts to wonder how her predecessors died, and turns to the only person with first-hand knowledge - Spike.

Meanwhile, Kendra gains a new found respect for Buffy's qualities as a Slayer. Later, the Slayers go after Willy to learn what happened to Angel. Buffy forces Willy to take her to the location of Spike and Angel, but Kendra refuses to accompany her because proper procedure dictates she return to tell her Watcher first, and she doesn't think they can stop the ritual alone. So Buffy alone accompanies Willy, but it's a trap-he takes her to the assassins, then together they go to the ritual which has already started. Spike orders Buffy's death, but at that moment, Kendra arrives to save her, along with Giles, Willow, Cordelia, and Xander. Xander and Cordelia work together in the hallway to kill the worm assassin; since he can only be destroyed in his "disassembled state," they lure the worms underneath a door into a sticky trap and then kill him by stomping on the worms. Willow and Giles work together to stake a vampire while Buffy and Kendra fight Patrice and Spike. Spike starts a fire and rushes to rescue the unconscious Drusilla, hoping that the ritual has had time to cure her. However, Buffy prevents their exit, crushing them in falling rubble. She rushes to the floor to help the weakened Angel, while everyone watches in awe, and she helps him exit the building, believing the fire would consume Spike and Drusilla.
|
On her way to the Bronze, Sunnydale's hippest (and only) club, Buffy is followed by a handsome, mysterious stranger. He tells her she must be ready for the Harvest, and gives her a small cross. Giles meets her at the Bronze and she tells him about the encounter. Giles convinces her to use her power, and wants her to try to sense if there are any vampires in the room. She does sense one and finds him talking to Willow, but the two have walked away. Trying to catch him unawares, she grabs a makeshift stake, turns a corner and attacks... Cordelia, the snootiest girl in school, who already thought Buffy was a loser for hanging with Willow, and now thinks shes certifiable. We see Jesse, Xander's buddy, chatting with a girl we saw in vampire garb earlier, but who now appears as a normal student, Darla. Back to the pool of blood, something breaks through the surface and rises: the demonic Master Vampire. He is hungry and weak, and asks Luke to bring him something young.

Willow and Buffy are talking in the kitchen. Xander arrives at the house and finds Buffy alone in the kitchen. He talks to her about Spike, but she knocks him out cold and drags him into the basement, where Willow is already bound and tape gagged. Buffy finds Dawn upstairs, after first opening a door and not finding her there, and chases her through the house as Dawn pleads that she is real. Dawn is bound and tape gagged in the basement with the others and with the chained demon.

"What am I supposed to do?" Buffy asks Principal Wood in his office. Seated at his desk, he says she did what she was supposed to, she reported it. Buffy isn't satisfied, but Wood tells her that kids talk big a lot of the time, saying stuff they don't mean. Wood pours them both a cup of coffee. Buffy says "But sometimes, sometimes it's not just talk, right?" to which Wood answers yes, but it's rare. Buffy asks what do they do then, and Wood sits back down, saying that they do the usual: inform teachers, search lockers." Buffy gets a little upset, walking over to Wood's desk and saying that she doesn't usually get a heads up when someone dies, but then backpeddals saying she has a chance to stop this from happening. Just then Buffy bumps the desk and spills her coffee on her shirt. She looks at the stain, slightly puzzled, remembering what Cassie said.
|
The Mayor and Faith plot to steal Angel's soul and let Angelus remove Buffy from the picture. An overconfident Faith reveals she's gone rogue, as well as details about the Mayor's Ascension, before Buffy and Angel tell her that it's all been a sting. Afterwards, Buffy tells Angel she needs some time apart.

Spike walks out of the garage door, slowly putting on his    leather duster, just as Buffy runs up and asks what happened. Spike sighs and    opens the garage door for her to see Robin, sitting on the ground against the    wall, battered and bloody but moving "I gave him a pass... let him live,    on the count of the fact that I killed his mother. But that's all he gets. He    even so much as looks funny at me again, I'll kill him." Spike then walks    off into the night as Buffy goes inside to check on Robin, helping him up to    a standing position with concern on her face. Buffy starts to talk about how    she discovered her mother when she died. She says she understands what he tried    to do, but it's different now. Spike is the strongest warrior they have and    they need him. "If you try anything like that again, he'll kill you. And    more importantly, I'll let him. I have a mission, to win this war, to save the    world. I don't have time for vendettas. The mission is what matters." She    says as she turns and walks away.

|
Taking Buffy to his house, Giles explains that Anyanka's power lies in her 'power center' and if it is destroyed, all the wishes she's ever granted will be reversed. Buffy is uninterested and simply asks how to kill her, but Giles explains that it isn't necessary. Buffy, who is emotionless and apathetic, doesn't care whether Anya lives or dies. Giles tells her that The Master is the supreme vampire in the town and is planning something for that evening. The Slayer immediately sets out to kill him. Giles tells her she'll need a plan, but she isn't interested in either of those and demands to know where The Master lives.

Before Giles can process the information, Jenny walks in and tells Giles that they need to talk. However, her attention quickly shifts to Xander, proving that the spell affected not only the girls, but every single female in town. Giles gets between the two and berates Xander for causing all this to happen. He then leaves Xander in the library, dragging Jenny along with him. After they leave, Xander tries to barricade the entrance to the library, but Buffy simply walks in, wearing nothing but a raincoat. She seductively asks Xander to undress her, but he can't, for he knows that what Buffy is doing is not out of attraction for him, but simply a result of the spell. Just then, Amy arrives and tells Buffy to leave. Instead, Buffy punches her to the floor. Angered, Amy gets up and casts a spell on Buffy, turning her into the small rat. Giles and Jenny return just then. While Xander and Giles try to catch the rat, Oz walks into the library and punches Xander for whatever he did to depress Willow. While Xander assures Oz that nothing happened, the rat escapes through the partly-opened library door. Realizing that the rat is gone, Giles commands Xander and Oz to find the rat while he tries to get Amy to reverse the spells. Giles soon determines that Amy must have made a mistake in the casting that caused Cordy to be protected by the spell instead of affected by it.

Buffy walks into her basement and up to Spike, who is now  chained to the wall in cuffs. She gets some water and a towel and starts mopping  up the blood from his chin and mouth and he wakes. "Did i hurt anybody?" "You  took a good bite outt of Andrew" she answers. "Who?" Spike tells her that he  doesn't remember and he doesn't know why, but Buffy says it's ok, they think  they've got it figured out. She says something is playing him and some ghost or  demon has figured out how to control him, and she tells about Xander's trigger  theory. Spike then looks Buffy square in the eye and says that she has to kill  him. Spike says she doesn't know what he's truly capable of. Buffy says she  knows, but Spike continues, saying she doesn't really know. "Do you know how  much blood you can drink from a girl before she'll die?

Buffy says it's  not his fault, he didn't do it, but he says it's too late, he's already done it  before. He says, practically orders her to kill him before he gets out. Spike  then asks her if she's ever wondered why she doesn't kill him. She says he's  helped save lives and protect people, he's helped, but Spike says "don't do  that... don't rationalize this into some nobel act. We both know the trutth of  it. You like me to hurt you. You need the pain we cause you, you need the hate.  you needed to be the slayer."

Buffy walks down the stairs into the basement, where we    find Spike sitting on a cot, chained to the wall. Spike asks Buffy if she's    gonna like the break away from the SIT's constantly running around. Buffy at    first says that it's not that bad, liking the responsibility, but upon further    thought "Oh, my god, I cannot believe I have my bathroom to myself for    two whole days!" she says, breathing a sigh of relief as she plops down    on the cot next to Spike. The two joke about how the SIT's have been running    amuck, then talk turns to Spike's voluntarily being chained up, saying it's    safer that he's under control while the SIT's are away, at least until they    are sure the First's control over him is over. Buffy agrees, saying it will    be easier to help him without the SIT's around. "Buffy..." says Spike    meaningfully, with a long intense gaze and pause."What?" she asks.    "Ow." He says calmly. "ow?" she questions? "Ow... ow...    owowOW!" he says as a pain in his head starts to steadily grow. He clutches    his forehead and slams back against the wall. Buffy asks what is wrong as he    slowly calms down enough to say "The chip...", then suddenly he convulses    violently again, enough to shake Buffy. He howls in pain as he grabs his head    again.

Buffy feels that life is unraveling since Willow's incident involving Dawn, a car, and Willow 'high' on magic. Dawn is barely speaking to Willow or Buffy-Willow because of her irresponsibility with Dawn, and Buffy because she let it happen by not being around enough, so she is only talking to Xander. Spike arrives under a blanket lookng for his lighter and Buffy denies seeing it. Willow is contrite about her misdeeds, and Buffy apologizes for being too self-involved with her own problems to notice Willow hurting. A social worker named Doris Kroeger comes to the Summers residence to check on how Buffy's doing as Dawn's legal guardian, but Buffy thought it was the next day and hadn't prepared for it. It's the worst possible time: as Buffy opens the door, Dawn makes a comment about the car accident; her arm is in a cast; and Xander is taking her late to school. The living room is scattered with Willow's old spell ingredients and objects, making a mess and also looking like drugs. Buffy tries to explain, saying "It's magic weed". Doris sees Spike and gets the impression that Buffy has a punk boyfriend who is sleeping over with her, since he has a blanket. Doris also appears to disapprove of Buffy living with another woman, one who is sleeping during the daytime.

Rising up from the hole, Spike says there's nothing there but dirt and slime.

I shall become more powerful than you ever imagined." Warren says that if "short round" can pull his thing off, they'll both become gods. "That boy is our last hope..." Andrew muses, turning towards Johnathan's direction. Warren continues the famous phrase "... No, there is another." "Really? who's our last hope?" Andrew asks, totally blowing the moment.

Commercial Break: Windex makes it SHINE!
|
Buffy and her friends find themselves in a realm where their worst nightmares become reality.
|
Buffy comes up against the Beast, who quickly proves to be far too powerful for the Slayer to handle. After taking quite a beating, Buffy is able to escape with the monk. The Beast throws a tantrum, causing the room to collapse on her, which delays her pursuit. Back at the Magic Box, Giles offers Anya a job when he realizes that the job is too much for just one, and that she enjoys handling the money.  In his last moments of life, the monk warns Buffy that she must protect The Key. He tells her that The Key is a collection of energy put into a human form-Dawn's form. They sent her to the Slayer to be protected from those looking for it. Buffy doesn't understand as she, her mom and all her friends have memories of Dawn's whole life, but the monk tells her that her memories are false. He also tells her that Dawn has no idea she is anything but human, and now not only needs the protection of the Slayer, but also the love of a sister. The monk dies, and Buffy returns home shaken by her new knowledge to find Dawn and Joyce waiting for her. Buffy apologizes to Dawn, who eventually accepts and the two girls are able to relate on at least one subject: their concern for their mother.

The next morning, everyone arrives at Sunnydale High in a yellow school bus. The Potentials head to the seal in the basement while Kennedy helps Willow set up her spell in Principal Wood's office. After trying to give a farewell speech, Andrew is dragged off by Anya. Dawn leaves to set up her post with Xander, determined to see her sister again. Principal Wood leaves to wait at his post for Giles. The core four share a moment talking about going to the mall after saving the world which causes Giles to say "the earth is definitely doomed". Xander and Willow walk down the hallway with Buffy before each one peels off, leaving Buffy walking alone to the seal. The Potentials, Faith, and Spike are waiting, and the Potentials/Slayers cut their hands to open the seal with their blood. They climb down the hole in the ground and come face to face with the army of Turok-Han. The Ubervamps spot Buffy, Faith, and the Potentials, and charge towards them. "Come on, Will," Buffy pleads.

Buffy tricks Luke to win her fight, making him believe an outside light is the sunlight from Daylight Savings Time, and then staking him while he has his back turned. With Luke dead, the Master's plan fails and he weakens again, but is not destroyed. The other vampires flee. Outside The Bronze, Angel realizes that Buffy has done it, saying: "I'll be damned".
|
Instantly in vamp face, Spike snarls and goes to the attack,    but Caleb pushes him back effortlessly to the ground. Spike comes up again and    charges, doing a punch and spinning back kick, but it doesn't even phase Caleb,    who punches back easily, then grabs Spike and throws him across the cellar into    a wine storage barrel, breaking it open and letting the vamp get drenched in    red wine.

Xander tracks Buffy down outside, but their attention is soon drawn to a pillar of smoke rising from the Grotto. Buffy makes it there first, and she finds the place going down in flames. Recognizing Willow on the other side of the flames, Buffy leaps to her friend's side. Buffy then spots a window wide enough for them to escape through, so she leaps up to kick it open. The cavemen take the escape route, followed by the two girls left behind. Xander helps Willow out through the window as Buffy pushes from inside. Instead of exiting right away, Buffy picks up a large piece of wood and inspects it thoroughly. Nearby, Parker regains consciousness and begs Buffy for help. Buffy swings the wood onto Parkers head, knocking him back to submission. She then drags him outside.

Back at the library, Buffy tries throwing knives at a target, missing it completely. When Giles walks in, she asks if he knows what might be happening to her. Meanwhile, Quentin Travers, the head Watcher, is setting up a "test" for the Slayer, assisted by two men named Hobson and Blair. She is to be locked up in a building, without any powers, and defeat a powerful and insane vampire named Zachary Kralik. Giles meets with Travers, and expresses his ambivalence about this test - it is supposed to strengthen Buffy, but he finds it unusually cruel. At home, Buffy is disappointed to find that her father canceled their ice show date, choosing work over her birthday. Later at the library, she tries hinting to Giles that he could take her to the ice show, though he fails to catch on. He has Buffy stare into another crystal to "find the tiny flaw at the center." When she falls into a trance, he injects her with a syringe before bringing her out of the trance, after which he agrees to send her home.

"Your Soul..." Buffy says.

"Tell me why you did this to her!" Kennedy faces    off against Amy, who smirks back. Kennedy then starts to lunge forward, but    with a wave of her hand, Amy throws Kennedy back into the theater's audience    seats with a blast of magic. Amy approaches her coldly, saying she put a hex    on Willow. Kennedy asks why make her take Warren's form, and why it happened    when they kissed. This makes Amy chuckle at how the Hex finally started. "The    Hex I cast let's the victim's subconsious choose the form of the punishment.    It's always better than anything I can come up with." Kennedy demands that    Amy undo it, and Amy eagerly agrees, then says "oh, wait... no." Kennedy    asks Amy if she really hates Willow that much, but Amy says it's not about hate,    it's about power and how Willow always had too much of it. Amy is jealous that    she had to work hard to only end up being half as powerful as Willow, who had    magic come too easily for her. Amy rants on how Willow was weak, giving into    evil, and it almost ended up destroying the world, but now everyone keeps loving    Willow as if nothing was wrong. Amy wanted to have a little fun taking Willow    down a peg or two. Kennedy is furious, questioning Amy's meaning of fun, and    saying that Willow is fading away. Amy says it's not her fault, it's Willow's    own fault. Amy then thinks and wonders where Willow might be about now. Kennedy    starts forward again, but Amy snaps her fingers...

Rona and Kennedy express concern over Spike's trigger being    active all this time and Buffy allowing him in the house, but Anya says "Don't    waste your time going down that road. Spike's got some sort of get-out-of-jail-free    card that doesn't apply to the rest of us. I mean, he could slaughter a 100    frat boys and..." and after some glares from all assembled "... forgiveness    makes us human, blahdy blah blah blah..." In the background the phone rings    and Andrew answers it, saying someone named Fred is on the phone for Willow.    "Guy sounds kinda effeminant."

Andrew rips some sheets into strips, complaining that they    look too "festive" for bandages, as Anya tends to the shoulder wound    of an SIT. "They look like mortally wounded Easter Baskets" she quips,    which makes the SIT question "what?" Anya picks up a before unseen    bottle of booze and takes a swig. Andrew complains, saying that they're supposed    to use that to sterilize the wounds, but Anya says "what does it matter?"    "Good point" says Andrew as he takes the bottle and takes a swig himself.    Andrew says that everything is horrible. "Yep, a slaughterhouse is what    it is" Anya says while still bandaging the SIT, who again says "What?!?"    "Awww, talking will just kill you sooner" Anya answers her.

Buffy stands at the bathroom door, trying to coax her out, saying it wasn't that bad, everything is ok. Dawn is sobbing behind the door then whips it open, saying RJ will never notice her now. "From what you said i'm sure he already noticed you..." Buffy tries to help but that was the wrong thing as Dawn slams the door in her face. Buffy continues to try and help as Xander appears, wondering if they're still on for movies and dinner. Buffy says probably not a good idea, but Xander says it's better than being with Spike and wonders if he should order a pizza "don't teens in a snit like pizza?"

Having heard the news, a sympathetic Buffy shows up at Willow's, all decked out in her prom dress. Willow is shell-shocked; even though she has faced vampires and death before, until this it has never been quite so personal. Buffy heads back to the library, where Giles has explained to Ms. Calendar that Buffy is the Slayer. Having used the information that was provided to him by Ms. Calendar, Giles discerns the Anointed One is still alive and is a child. He then tells Ms. Calendar that he intends to face the Master so Buffy doesn't have to but Buffy, having overheard everything, stops him having realized she can't escape destiny. Giles tries to stop her, telling her he's willing to defy the prophecy, so Buffy knocks him out. Ms. Calendar reminds Buffy that if she faces the Master she'll die, and Buffy responds that at the least she may be able to take him down with her. Outside of school, she finds the Anointed One asking for help. Buffy tells him she knows who is and allows him to lead her to the Master's lair.

Back at his house, Giles is deep into a solo rendition of Lynyrd Skynyrd's "Free Bird" when Spike suddenly announces his presence.  Spike offers to steal files with information about Adam from the Initiative in exchange for amnesty from the stake and a large amount of cash.  Giles agrees to the offer, but Spike will only take the word of the Slayer, not a retired librarian who is no longer a respected authority figure.  As Spike leaves, Giles lets Spike's words sink in and wallows in feelings of inadequacy.  Tara and Willow discuss future class schedules and living arrangements in Tara's dorm room.  As Willow decides on taking a chance on Drama class, Tara asks Willow where she plans on living next year. Willow expresses her doubts about living with Buffy the following year.

In the fantastical cult favorite's fifth-season finale and 100th episode, Buffy and her brave band of Scoobies make one last play for Glory -- who holds Dawn's life (not to mention the fate of the world) in her hands. Glory (Clare Kramer) trumped the good guys when she stole the Slayer's little sis out from under her nose. In a race against time, Buffy (Sarah Michelle Gellar) and pals must now execute a risky plan to rescue Dawn before her blood is spilled  which would open a portal to Glory's demonic dimension, creating a literal hell on Earth.

The gang gather the next day for brainstorming, but no one is sure what this thing is and Buffy is still very closed off. At the Magic Box, Buffy still seems out of place and leaves to patrol alone. With Buffy gone, the demon has taken over Dawn who shouts at her friends and breathes fire before collapsing. Buffy finds Spike at his crypt and the two talk, rather awkwardly at first. Spike opens up to her, expressing his guilt for not saving her or Dawn.

Willow tries to see if her spell worked, but her commands don't work. Giles drops by to find out why she didn't show to help him perform the spell. She feels like there's too much pressure on her that she can't live up to, and snaps at Giles when he tells her that she needs to focus on her responsibilities and not to perform any more spells alone while she's in such a fragile state. Angry, she says that he can't see anything, and then Giles suddenly begins to have trouble with his eyesight and decides it's best to leave for now. He then tries to perform the spell on Spike alone but is having difficulty reading. After Giles drops the key to the chains keeping Spike captive, Spike is able to break free and run away. While talking to Buffy, one of Willow's casual comments briefly returns Amy to human form (unseen by either girl), before Willow just as casually - and unwittingly - turns her back into a rat.

Two Bringers hold a terrified Amanda as a third brandishes    their favorite weapon, the ornate dagger. As the third approaches for the kill,    Dawn gets up and grabs one of those metal clicky-spark thingys used to ignight    gas burners, she ignights one of the chem lab's gas outlets (which I'm guessing    she turned on earlier in the fight? I probably missed it) and flame shoots out,    blowing the three Bringers and Amanda down. Amanda gets up and takes off out    of the room with Dawn and they run down the hallway, Dawn still clutching the    flag pole mast. Seeing that they're not being pursued, they stop on a staircase's    landing as Amanda asks what those things were. Dawn then lays it out for Amanda,    saying that she herself is not special, Amanda is the special one, and this    is not her battle. Amanda is still paniced and says she can't do it. At the    bottom of the landing arrives Xander, who watches the two girls but doesn't    say anything. Dawn says to Amanda that it's her battle and she can do it. Dawn    almost ceremoniously passes the flag pole mast to Amanda, who takes it, still    not quite sure what to do. Just then, from the hallway, the three Bringers along    with the Vampire arrive in pursuit! As they charge down the hallway towards    Dawn and Amanda, Xander yells out "Buffy, up here!" as Xander climbs    up the stairs. Buffy and Spike soon appear and head up the stairs.

In a lecture room at the college, Giles tells the story of the Gentlemen through drawings and text on an overhead projector, with musical embellishment. They travel into a town to collect seven human hearts, and they collect all the voices so that no-one can scream as a human voice is the only thing that can kill them. They are immune to weaponry such as swords and stakes... only the sound of a real human voice - not a recorded one, despite Willow's suggestion - can kill them and they have collected at least two of the seven human hearts they need. Unfortunately, Giles does not know how to get everyone's voices back, so has everyone else research while Buffy patrols while Riley suits up and then prepares to do the same.

Caleb tries to be tough, but he's obviously scared of the    weapon in the Slayer's hands. He suggests that she give the scythe to him before    she hurts herself, but Buffy simply shifts it confidently from hand to hand.    He then says that she doesn't even know what she's got, but Buffy says "I    know you're backing away." Caleb starts up again, but Buffy/The First appears    at his side and tells him to let it go (it is unclear if Buffy can see the First    or not in this scene, but it seems like it). The First tells Caleb to let her    go, she's got other things to worry about, such as her friends (quipping "Faith    go boom"). Caleb doesn't want to let her leave, but listens to the First    and stands still as Buffy takes off up the hole to the cavern, the First saying    that Buffy will be back and that they can take the scythe from her then.

Sam, as Riley later introduces as her, quickly jumps into a fight with the Suvolte demon. Buffy recovers from the shock of Riley being married and Riley starts to catch her up on his life since he left as they watch Sam deliver quite a beating to the demon. The demon strikes Sam and Riley rushes to help her as Buffy approaches the demon from behind and snaps its neck. Riley's shocked that she killed it and Buffy soon finds out from Sam that they weren't trying to kill it. Improvising, Sam takes a knife from Riley and cuts into the demon's gut as Buffy watches on, still confused. Sam observes that they're too late and the three head for Buffy's home where it should be safe. Riley mentions that Sam's good cutting skills are because she's a doctor and promises Buffy that he'll take the time to fill her in on everything.

Summers home, Daytime. Buffy looks in on Willow, who sits crossed legged in her bedroom. Willow says it's ok, she's meditating and healing herself, growing new skin by drawing power from the Earth. Buffy wonders "we're on the second floor..." Willow sits back, tired and in pain. Buffy says she's going to leave and let her rest, but Willow asks her to stay. Buffy says she missed her, and wonders how this invisible thing happened. Willow says she cast a spell without realizing it, fearing the facing of her friends so much that she literally could not see them. It happened just by Willow thinking it. Willow says it's nice to be forgiven, especially with so much to be forgiven for.

In need of clothes, Oz and Veruca head to a nearby laundry room and raid one of the dryers. While Oz throws on some fitting clothes, Veruca expresses her joy with being a werewolf, including her ability to remember some of the events that occur while she's in her altered state. Veruca informs Oz that he'll be able to retain his memory in a matter of time, and that he is the werewolf not just three days per month, but rather every single day. Oz refuses to believe a word of what Veruca is saying, and he takes off to see if anybody was attacked the previous night. Following Xander's advice to talk about her problem, Willow visits Oz at his place, where he is busy going through the current newspapers. When Oz shows some reluctancy in getting intimate with her, Willow backs off and tries to get him to open up. Failing to do so, Willow leaves Oz alone. Meanwhile, Professor Walsh tells Buffy and Riley that she was attacked by a pair of wild dogs the previous night. Familiar with this scenario, Buffy visits Giles and tells him about the attack. He wonders if Buffy has spoken to Oz about this, and she explains that she's heading there next. Buffy finds Oz at the cemetery, working on repairs to the cage. She asks Oz if he knows anything about the attack or any other werewolves in the area, but Oz denies any knowledge.

After Riley walks in, Willow makes sure that Buffy remembers their planned get-together at the Bronze later that evening.  Meanwhile, Giles pays a visit to Spike's new home in the cemetery.  Giles tries to motivate him towards joining their cause, but the only thing that Spike is interested in is the money that Giles owes him.  Swearing off any future relations with the good guys, Spike orders Giles to leave.  Later, Riley accompanies Buffy on her first trip into the Initiative laboratory beneath the surface of Sunnydale.  Upon stepping out of the elevator, Buffy marvels at the vastness of the facility.  Maggie Walsh greets them and escorts them to the central testing area, which is called the Pit.  Buffy notices an unfamiliar pair of demons that are being observed by scientists, and Riley tells her about the difficulty of their capture.  By the armory, Maggie shows Buffy a communication camera headset prototype that also reads the heart rate of whoever is wearing it.  After the tour, Maggie issues a pager to Buffy in order to alert her to any future missions.  Once the Slayer is gone, Maggie enters the restricted-access 314 lab, where Dr. Angleman is working on their secret project: a hideous biological weapon that they are creating out of various demon body parts.

Buffy and Cordelia are both drugged at the party and chained in the basement with the young woman from the cemetery. Back at school, a broken, bloody bracelet Buffy found at the cemetery is traced by Willow and Giles to the woman who had been chased. Willow's hacking skills lead to more info -- a year earlier to the day, three other women disappeared and were never found. They go to the frat party with Angel and Xander just as the three women are about to be offered up as a sacrifice to Machida, a snake-like demon who arises every year and is worshipped by the frat boys. Buffy manages to break loose and a scuffle ensues. Tom, who turns out to be way wicked, is about to cut Buffy's throat, but she grabs the sword and defeats Machida. Cordelia, messy but undaunted, chides Tom as he is led away with a typically pithy remark: "You're going to jail for fifteen thousand years!" Giles forgives Buffy for her lie, and Angel shows up at the Bronze and asks Buffy out for coffee. She grins and takes a rain check, as any self-respecting slayer would, and all is well again at the unpredictable Hellmouth.

"My mother loved me with all her heart. I was her world"    Spike says as he walks over to the computer and taps the mouse, starting the    song playing again. Spike stands, unaffected, saying it's a nice song, then    he shuts it off and walks towards Robin, still sitting against the wall, beaten    "Thanks Doc, you cured me after all! I've got my own free will now. I'm    not under the First's or anyone else's influences now. I just wanted you to    know that... before I kill you." Spike puts on his game face and goes into    Robin's neck.

Willow and Xander get Buffy home and she recounts what she saw and was told at the mental hospital, Dawn hurt when told she doesn't exist in Buffy's 'ideal' alternate reality. While Willow organizes a plan to research, Buffy falls back to the 'reality' of the mental hospital, where her doctor explains to her parents that she has been catatonic from schizophrenia for all of the past six years  and that her life as the Slayer has been an elaborate improvised hallucination she has constructed for herself in her mind, explaining what Buffy realizes is its extreme improbability and illogicality compared to the 'mental patient' scenario.

With all that happening the Scoobies go to the basement of Buffy's house, where Willow makes a spell with the Prokaryote Stone, a magical artifact that penetrates Spike's mind and makes him more conscious of how the trigger works. In this way, we learn about his past, his sick mother, and how he turned her into a vampire only to be cruelly rejected by her newly vampiric self. The song that his mother used to sing makes him relive the whole episode and switch into his evil, soulless self. He unwillingly hurts Dawn in the process and scares them all, except Buffy. Meanwhile, Willow receives a phone call from a girl named Fred and quickly leaves for Los Angeles. She apologizes to Buffy for her quick departure, but promises to be back as soon as she can, and she may even return with good news.

Buffy comes up behind him "you're a dope. You're a    dope, and a bonehead..." Spike doesn't know what she's talking about. Buffy    explains that the scythe is probably the key to everything and the only reason    she found it is because of the strength that Spike gave her last night. Buffy    says that she doesn't want mixed signals (she's got Faith for that), and doesn't    know how Spike felt about last night, but... "Terrified" Spike admits.    Putting his heart on his sleeve, Spike admits that that night was the best night    of his life. He's lived forever, done everything, but he's never been close    to anyone, even her, until last night. So yes, he's terrified. "You don't    have to be." Buffy says. "Were you there with me last night?"    He asks. "I was." she answers. "What does that mean?" he    asks. "I dunno... does it have to mean something?" she wonders."No,    not right now" Spike says, then he slowly drops the subject, walking out    the back door, ready for them all to be heroes.

So hear us cheer, hear us yell, listen what we say, Razorbacks, Razorbacks, Goooooo... RJ!" She lands sprawled out on the floor in a failed cartwheel as the audience and judges mumble and snicker slightly.

Anya breaks the grim mood, enthusiastically trying to perk everyone up in order to get some suggestions or a battle plan together to stop Glory before the ritual.

No-one can work out how to kill Glory, but then Willow points out they don't need to... Glory only has one opportunity to perform the ritual, if she fails then she won't get another chance and Dawn will be safe from her. It's simply a case of keeping her busy until her window of opportunity has passed. Anya continues to press for ideasand points out two items the Scoobies have possession of that could help; the Dagon Sphere, which is supposed to repel Glory, and Olaf's hammer (which Buffy, with her enhanced strength, can easily wield). Although the workings of a good plan are starting to form Buffy points out the gang still have no way to find Glorywhen Tara suddenly starts to try and leave babbling that she has places to be. Everyone realizes that Tara is being instinctively drawn to where the ritual is taking place, so it'll be a matter of following her when the time comes.

The next day at the magic shop, Dawn writes in her journal that everything seems to have worked out okay - Anya is going to be fine and Xander isn't mad at her. Meanwhile, as Buffy and Giles look through boxes, Buffy asks Giles if he's sure about being the shop's new owner since the life expectancy of magic shop owners in Sunnydale is so short. He says that he was a librarian for years and it's not much different except that people pay for the things they are not returning. When Giles and Buffy go into the back to see if there's enough space to do their training, Buffy comes back and warns Dawn to not break anything. She leaves and comes back again to tell her not to touch anything. She comes back one more time to tell Dawn that not doing anything would be good.

He peers through a window where he finds the imposter is already there, advising Giles, Buffy and Riley that they have to find and kill his imposter. The imposter informs Buffy that he will be at the new apartment with Anya while she finds and slays the other Xander, who they conclude must be the demon Toth. A desperate Xander goes to Willow's to explain to her what really happened. He tells Willow that the imposter seems to have hypnotized Buffy, and Willow looks for a spell to snap her out of it. Xander is upset and confides in Willow that it seems like his imposter is doing everything better; he's smarter, people are treating him better and maybe he should just let the demon keep his identity. Willow convinces Xander that he is a good person and shouldn't let the demon win. Remembering that the imposter made plans with Anya, Xander takes off, determined not to let the demon have her too. Xander shows up at Anya's place, but Anya is nowhere to be found. At the imposter's new apartment, the imposter convinces an unknowing Anya that he got the new apartment entirely for her because he knew that she wanted it.

Throwing    stars, a boomerang, the large old book, various items are taken out and examined.    Dawn takes the book and hints that she's been researching it, trying to translate    it. Anya sees the box and asks Wood what's inside. He says it's locked so he's    never known, but Buffy breaks the lock off and opens it without hesitation.    "Heh hehh hehhhh huhhhh.... Puppets..." says Xander with a smile and    laugh as he picks up a metallic cut-out outline of a man from the box. Xander    then gets the idea that the First hates Puppets and they can attack it with    Kermit, Fozzy and Ms. Piggy. Willow corrects him, saying "those are Muppets."    Dawn tells them the metallic items are "shadow casters", meant to    cast shadows upon a wall in a certain order to tell a story. She refers to the    book, saying it says "You have to watch, not just see." Buffy asks    what it means. Dawn says her translating breaks down there, but she thinks it    will describe an origin myth, the story of the first Slayer. Buffy then tells    them she saw the first Slayer in her dream the last night.

"Whaddya think?" Buffy, holding the scythe firmly    in hand, addresses Giles, Xander, Anya, Faith, Dawn, and Willow about her new,    unheard-of-by-the-audience plan. Xander is beyond belief. Faith says that it's    pretty radical. Giles rises in confusion "It's a lot more than that...    Buffy, what you said, it flies in the face of every thing, every generation    has ever done. I think it's bloody brilliant!" Buffy asks if he means it.    Giles says if she wants him to. The both of them share smiling glances, knowing    they have each other's respect again. Willow now speaks up, in typical flustered    Willow-ese, saying that her part of the plan is going to require magics stronger    than anything she's ever done before, saying it's a total loss of control, comparing    it to experiencing her girlfriend's tounge stud. Buffy says that she wouldn't    have asked Willow if she didn't think she could do it. Giles also lends his    support, saying she's strong enough to control it. Just then Dawn goes "Oh!    Tounge stud..." and nods understanding, which makes Buffy hint that Dawn    should go and do some research. Dawn the "Jr. Watcher" leaves, with    Giles following. Anya and Xander go out to assemble the "cannon fodder"    as Anya calls them (but not to their faces), leaving Willow and Buffy alone.

Buffy finally decides she wants to leave Sunnydale, and goes to Wesley to tell him.  Wesley tells her she can't leave Sunnydale, especially with Faith gone bad and the Mayor's ascension coming up.  Buffy asks him if she could go if she can stop the ascension, which would mean Wesley and Giles would only have to take care of the run-of-the-mill stuff, and she could take care of the major stuff when she came home on breaks.  Wesley and Giles consider the possibility, but tell Buffy that to consider it seriously, Buffy would have to stop the Mayor's ascension.  She suggests taking the fight to them - taking the offensive rather than just waiting for it to happen to them.  They all agree that it's a good idea, and Buffy heads off to find out what Faith and the Mayor are up to.  She heads to City Hall, where she spies Faith bringing a big box inside.
